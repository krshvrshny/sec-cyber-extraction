ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS

Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described below, which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results, and may affect the trading price and price volatility of our Class A and Class C stock.

Risks Specific to our Company

We generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers, a loss of partners, shifts in online advertising, new and evolving advertising formats, or new or existing technologies that block ads online or affect our ability to personalize ads could harm our business.

We generated more than 70% of total revenues from online advertising in 2025. Many of our advertisers, companies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their contracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective monetization) than their available alternatives. 

We believe AI is quickly reshaping the advertising industry, including how ads are delivered online, and we and our competitors are constantly adjusting to meet this shift and provide new and evolving advertising formats. There is no assurance that we will adapt effectively and competitively to meet this shift, and that such advertising formats, strategies, and offerings will be successful.

Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, as well as changes to other companies' advertising or data privacy practices have in the past, and may in the future, affect the advertising services that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have been developed that make personalized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online services have integrated technologies that could impair the availability and functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

Expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in fluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.

Our increasing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and could divert management attention and harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. 

We have invested and expect to expand our investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies in a wide range of industries beyond online advertising. The investments that we are making across our businesses — such as building AI-optimized infrastructure, including our custom TPUs, and integrating AI capabilities into new and existing products and services — reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and provide products and services that are helpful to users, advertisers, publishers, customers, content providers, and distribution partners. Our investments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and, in pursuing new strategies, we may incur unanticipated liabilities. 

To meet the compute capacity demands of AI training and inference, as well as traditional cloud computing services, we are entering into significant leasing arrangements with third party operators, which may increase costs and operational complexity. We also have a number of large, long-duration commercial agreements, which could increase our liabilities and obligations in the event of nonperformance by us, our counterparties, or vendors. In such nonperformance or an industry downturn, we may incur additional liabilities, have excess capacity that we cannot easily redeploy, and not receive payments from our counterparties or customers.

We have invested and expect to significantly expand our investment in property and equipment, including our technical infrastructure, and we expect these assets to benefit our business over their estimated useful lives. Changes in facts and circumstances such as changes to historical asset performance, expected technology advancements, and future network deployment plans could change the period over which we expect to benefit from the asset and impact our financial condition and operating results.

Innovations in our products and services could also result in changes to user and customer behavior and affect our revenue trends. These endeavors involve significant risks and uncertainties, including diversion of resources and management attention from current operations, different monetization models, and the use of alternative investment, governance, or compensation structures that may fail to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives.

Alphabet Inc.

Within Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in devices, including our smartphones, home devices, and wearables, which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, increased market saturation in developed countries, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in performance characteristics, and price and feature sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. There can be no assurance we will be able to provide devices that compete effectively. 

Within Google Cloud, we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, and we are advancing our AI platforms and models to support these tools and technologies, including the development of our custom TPUs and how we deliver them to our customers. We are incurring significant and increasing costs and new liabilities, including contingent liabilities, to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services, invest in cybersecurity, and hire talent. Meanwhile, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services and capacity. Pricing and delivery models, which are subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny and requirements, are competitive and constantly evolving, and we may therefore not achieve our business objectives. Further, our business with financial services, healthcare, and public sector customers may present additional risks, including regulatory compliance risks. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and cost reviews, and any failure to comply or any deficiencies found may expose us to legal, financial, and reputational risks. Evolving laws and regulations may require us to make new capital investments, build new products, and seek partners to deliver localized services in other countries, and we may not be able to meet sovereign operating requirements.

Within Other Bets, we are investing significantly in areas such as life sciences and transportation, among others. These investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors, and our offerings, many of which involve the development of new and emerging technologies, may not be successful, or be able to compete effectively or operate at sufficient levels of profitability. 

In addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI, raise ethical, technological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which could harm our brands and demand for our products and services. Because all of these investment areas are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful or will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. 

We face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, customers, and other partners, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. 

Our business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully, we must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant, and useful products, services, and technologies in a timely manner. For example, with the rise of AI in recent years, we have increasingly focused our investments in building powerful AI tools and AI enhancements to our existing products and services to better cater to our users, customers, and other partners. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in technical infrastructure, including the development of our custom TPUs, and research and development, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology, products, and services. 

We have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer operating histories and well-established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions and entering into other strategic arrangements; continuing to invest heavily in technical infrastructure, research and development, and in talent; initiating intellectual property and competition claims (whether or not meritorious); and continuing to compete for users, advertisers, customers, and content providers. Further, discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to aggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny, thereby affording them competitive advantages. Our competitors may also be able to innovate and provide products and services faster or more cost effectively than we can or may foresee the need for products and services before we do. 

We are developing frontier generative AI models and building AI capabilities into products and services across the company, tailoring them to the evolving preferences of our users and customers. AI technology and services are highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and require significant investment, including technical infrastructure, development, and operational costs. Our ability to deploy certain AI technologies critical for our products and services and for our business strategy may depend on the availability and pricing of third-party equipment and other technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, and equipment costs. Additionally, other companies may develop 

10.  


Alphabet Inc.

AI products and technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies or more cost-effective to develop or deploy. Other companies may also have (or in the future may obtain) patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use, or sell our own AI products and services.

Our financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive in a timely manner to the evolving needs and desires of our users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers, or if we miscalculate those needs and desires and invest significantly in areas that fail to gain sufficient market traction. As new and existing technologies continue to develop, competitors and new entrants may be able to offer experiences that are, or that are perceived to be, substantially similar to or better than ours, and the consumers may change how they obtain information online, potentially reducing the utility of our existing products and services. These technologies could reduce usage of our products and services, and force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources to develop and operate equal or better products and services. Competitors' success in providing compelling products and services or in attracting and retaining users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers could harm our financial condition and operating results. 

Our revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we may experience downward pressure on our operating margin in the future. 

Our revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including changes in customer usage and demand for our existing products and increasing demand for competing technologies; changes in the devices and modalities used to access our products and services; changes in geographic mix; deceleration or declines in advertiser spending; competition; decreases in the pricing of our products and services; ongoing product and policy changes; and shifts to lower priced products and services. 

We may experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors. These include increasing costs for many aspects of our business resulting from a higher level of investment in technical infrastructure, increasing regulations, and increasing competition. Certain of our costs and expenses are relatively fixed and may not correlate to changes in revenue, and we may also not be able to continue to drive efficiencies at the rate we have in the past. We may also face margin compression from an increase in the mix of lower-margin products and services, in particular from the continued expansion of our business into new fields, including products and services such as Google Cloud, our devices, and consumer subscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets. For instance, margins on our devices have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our consolidated margins due to pricing pressures and higher cost of sales. Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance. For additional information, see Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect and Revenues and Monetization Metrics in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brands as well as affect our ability to compete. 

Our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have taken and may take in the future to protect our proprietary rights, including obtaining copyright and patent protections for our important innovations, including AI innovations, may not be sufficient or effective. There is also the possibility that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable. 

We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The confidentiality of such trade secrets and other sensitive information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word "Google" could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word "search." Some courts have ruled that "Google" is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the US, may reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark. 

Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and ability to compete. Protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming; any increase in unauthorized use could make it more expensive to do business and harm our financial condition and operating results. 

Our business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. 

Our strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch 

11.  


Alphabet Inc.

new and innovative products and services that better serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. Our brands have been, and may in the future be, harmed by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy and security issues and developments, issues in delivering age-appropriate experiences to minors, and product or technical performance failures. For example, if we fail to respond appropriately to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services or products or objectionable practices by advertisers, or otherwise to adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our brands. Furthermore, failure to maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality, trustworthy, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a range of settings. 

We face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could affect our ability to supply our products and services and  harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. 

We rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our devices as well as servers and networking equipment used in our technical infrastructure, certain components of which we may supply. We also rely on third parties to supply components and distribute our products and services. Our business could be harmed if we are not able to engage these companies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them. 

We have experienced and may in the future experience supply shortages, price increases, quality issues, or longer lead times that could harm our operations, driven by raw material or component availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, logistics capacity, inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, tariffs, sanctions and export controls, trade disputes and barriers, forced labor concerns, sourcing requirements, geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, natural disasters or pandemics, the effects of climate change, power and transmission availability, and significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers. Some of the components we use in our technical infrastructure and our devices are available from only one or limited sources, and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption. A significant supply interruption that affects us or our vendors could delay critical data center or network infrastructure upgrades or expansions and delay consumer product availability. 

Our ability to scale our technical infrastructure is increasingly constrained by the availability of power, water, and land. For example, energy supply is constrained globally due to the significant increase in demand for and limited availability of energy to power AI compute. Securing this capacity involves entering into complex, long-lead-time arrangements. Additionally, manufacturing and supply of servers and network equipment for our technical infrastructure, particularly for specialized AI chips, is limited to a small number of qualified suppliers. Extended or unforeseen disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to meet customer demand. Failure to secure sufficient capacity in a timely manner would limit our ability to train models and serve Cloud customers.

We may enter into long-term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and conditions. We may face costs for materials and products that are not consumed due to market demand, technological change, excess or obsolete inventory, changed consumer preferences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. Certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may affect our supply. For example, industry supply capacity for AI accelerators, including GPUs as well as our custom-built TPUs, is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. If we are unable to negotiate favorable contractual terms or our competitors claim the supply or capacity first, we may face increased costs and supply constraints, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.

Our devices have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from design, manufacturing, or operations. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers. In addition, quality issues with equipment used in our technical infrastructure could constrain our capacity to support the delivery and continued development of our products and services. If the quality of our products and services does not meet expectations, we lack the capacity to deliver them, or our products or services are defective or require a corrective action or recall, it could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. 

We require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and, where applicable, our company policies and practices, such as the Google Supplier Code of Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data security, environmental compliance, and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices. Violations of law or unethical business practices could result in supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, harm to key relationships, and damage to our reputation. Their failure to procure necessary license rights to intellectual property could affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims. 

12.  


Alphabet Inc.

Interruption to, interference with, or failure of our complex information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. 

The availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage, interference, or interruption from modifications or upgrades, terrorist attacks, state-sponsored attacks, natural disasters or pandemics, geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, export controls and sanctions, tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers, the effects of climate change, power and transmission availability challenges, utility outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, software bugs, cyber attacks, supply-chain attacks, computer denial of service attacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to harm or access our systems. Some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and, in some cases, to potential disruptions resulting from problems experienced by facility operators or disruptions as a result of geopolitical tensions and conflicts happening in the area. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic, closure of a facility, or other unanticipated problems affecting our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and have contained in the past, and may contain in the future, errors or vulnerabilities, which could result in interruptions in or failure of our services or systems. Any of these incidents could impede or prevent us from effectively offering products and providing services, which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. 

Our international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

Our international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to continue growing internationally. International revenues accounted for approximately 52% of consolidated revenues in 2025. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including:

•restrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the US;

•sanctions, tariffs, import and export controls, other market access barriers, political unrest, geopolitical tensions, changes in regimes, or armed conflict (such as ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine), any of which may affect our business continuity, increase our operating costs, limit demand for our products and services, limit our ability to source components or final products, or prevent or impede us from operating in certain jurisdictions, complying with local laws, or offering products or services;

•longer payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud;

•an evolving foreign policy landscape that could harm our revenues and could subject us to litigation, new regulatory costs and challenges (including new customer requirements), uncertainty regarding regulatory outcomes, and other liabilities under local laws that may not offer due process or clear legal precedent;

•anti-corruption laws, such as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain payments to government officials, violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties; and

•different employee/employer relationships; different labor laws, regulations, and labor practices; and other challenges caused by distance, language, local expertise, and cultural differences, increasing the complexity of doing business in multiple jurisdictions.

Because we conduct business in currencies other than US dollars but report our financial results in US dollars, we have faced, and will continue to face, exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the US dollar and foreign currencies have and may in the future adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Hedging programs are also inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial condition and operating results. 

Disruptions in our ability to access future financing or manage our indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategy and harm our financial condition.

We may from time to time access capital markets for debt or seek to enter into other forms of financing, such as leases. Any difficulty in accessing capital markets, entering into other forms of financing on favorable terms, or managing our existing indebtedness could increase our costs of financing and restrict our ability to invest in our business. Furthermore, the combination of our current and any future indebtedness, including obligations arising under 

13.  


Alphabet Inc.

leases, backstops, guarantees, and potential liabilities from large commercial agreements, could harm our financial condition and reduce our financial and business flexibility.

We are exposed to fluctuations in the fair values of our investments and, in some instances, our financial statements incorporate inherently subjective valuation methodologies. 

The fair value of our debt and equity investments may in the future be, and certain investments have been in the past, negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, performance and financial results of the underlying entities, foreign exchange rates, changes in interest rates, the effect of new or changing regulations, the stock market in general, or other factors. As a result of these factors, the value of our investments could significantly decline, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.

We measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt securities, and certain other instruments including stock-based compensation (SBC) awards of Other Bet companies, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, which is inherently subjective and requires management judgment and estimation. Gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities are recognized in other income (expense), net (OI&E), which increases the volatility of our OI&E. The unrealized gains and losses or impairments we record from fair value remeasurements in any particular period may differ significantly from the gains and losses we ultimately realize on such investments. Changes in fair value on SBC awards are recognized primarily through operating expenses.

Risks Related to our Industry 

Issues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational harm and increased liability exposure. 

Our evolving AI-enabled products and services may give rise to risks related to harmful content, inaccuracies, discrimination, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, violation of rights of publicity, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity, minor protection, and other issues. As a result of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies, our implementation of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability (including under new and proposed legislation and regulations), new applications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws, and brand or reputational harm. 

Some uses of AI will present ethical issues and may have broad effects on society. In order to implement AI responsibly and minimize unintended harmful effects, we have already devoted and will continue to invest significant resources to develop, test, and maintain our products and services, but we may not be able to identify or resolve all AI-related issues, deficiencies, and failures before they arise. Unintended consequences, uses, or customization of our AI tools and systems may negatively affect human rights, privacy, employment, or other social concerns, which may result in claims, lawsuits, brand or reputational harm, and increased regulatory scrutiny, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.

People access our products and services through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to evolve with the advancement of technology and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of our products and services developed for these interfaces, our business could be harmed. 

While the modalities used to access information is evolving, people access our products and services through a growing variety of devices such as phones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables (including virtual reality and augmented reality devices), automobiles, and television-streaming devices. Our products and services may be less popular on some interfaces. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not be available or may only be available with limited functionality for our users or our advertisers on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices. 

It is hard to predict the challenges we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to creating and supporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices. Failing to attract and retain a substantial number of device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, developers, and users, or failing to develop products and technologies that work well on new devices and platforms, could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results and ability to capture future business opportunities. 

Problematic content on our platforms, including low-quality user-generated content, web spam, content farms, and other violations of our guidelines could affect the quality of our services, which could harm our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services. 

We, like others in the industry, face violations of our content guidelines across our platforms, including sophisticated attempts by bad actors to manipulate our hosting and advertising systems to fraudulently generate revenues, or to otherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest or intent. While we invest 

14.  


Alphabet Inc.

significantly in efforts to promote high-quality and relevant results and to detect and prevent low-quality content and invalid traffic, we have been unable and may continue to be unable to detect and prevent all such abuses or promote uniformly high-quality content. Increased use of AI in our offerings and internal systems may create new instances of problematic content and increased potential for misuse and abuse.

Many websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in search results than our search engine's assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts have affected, and may continue to affect, the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false, misleading, or undesirable content. Although English-language web spam in our search results has been reduced, and web spam in most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their rankings. Although we continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam on our platforms and to evolve our policies to address emerging threats, there is no guarantee that our technology and policy enforcement will always be successful, and our users may have negative experiences that make them less likely to use our platforms. We face legal and regulatory challenges to our efforts to address low-quality content, and our ability to address it may be constrained or made more costly through added compliance requirements. We also face other challenges to the quality of our search results from low-quality and irrelevant content websites, including content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content in an effort to improve their search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to detect and prevent these efforts, but we may not always be successful. We also face other challenges on our platforms, including attempted election interference; fraud, content inappropriate for minors, misleading or deceptive information, and other types of potentially harmful content. 

If we fail to either detect and prevent an increase in problematic content or effectively promote high-quality content, it could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our financial condition and operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory actions, which could result in monetary penalties and damages and divert management's time and attention.

Data privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could harm our reputation, cause us to incur significant liability, and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services. Computer viruses, software bugs or defects, security breaches, and attacks on our systems could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users' and customers' ability to use our products and services, harming our business and reputation. 

Concerns about, including the adequacy of, our practices with regard to the collection, use, governance, disclosure, or security of personal data or other data-privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our policies and practices may change over time as expectations and regulations regarding privacy and data change. 

Our products and services involve the storage, handling, and transmission of proprietary and other sensitive information. Malicious software such as viruses, software bugs, theft, misuse, defects, vulnerabilities in our products and services, as well as cyber attacks, phishing schemes, and other types of security attacks, which increasingly use AI, expose us to a risk of loss or improper use and disclosure of such information, which could result in litigation and other potential liabilities, including regulatory fines and penalties, as well as reputational harm. Additionally, our products incorporate highly technical and complex technologies, and thus our technologies and software have contained, and are likely in the future to contain, undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. We continue to add new features involving AI to our offerings and internal systems, and features that rely on AI may be susceptible to unanticipated security threats as our and the market's understanding of AI-centric security risks and protection methods continue to develop. We have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, some errors in our software code only after we have released the code. Systems and control failures, security breaches, failure to comply with our privacy policies, and inadvertent disclosure of user data could result in regulatory and legal exposure, seriously harm our reputation, brand, and business, and impair our ability to attract and retain users or customers. Such incidents have occurred in the past and may continue to occur due to the scale and nature of our products and services. While there is no guarantee that such incidents will not cause significant damage, we expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain security protections that limit the effect of bugs, theft, misuse, and security vulnerabilities or breaches. 

We experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis. Cyber attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. The development and implementation of AI technologies may further increase our exposure to or exacerbate the risks of cyber attacks or other security incidents, particularly where such technologies are exploited by third parties to breach our or other parties' systems, including when such technologies are used to target our employees or impersonate members of senior management in order to gain unauthorized access to our systems. We have also seen, and will continue to see, industry-wide software supply chain vulnerabilities and attacks on telecommunications 

15.  


Alphabet Inc.

and other critical infrastructure, which could affect our or other parties' systems. We expect to continue to experience such incidents or vulnerabilities in the future. Our efforts to prevent security incidents and address undesirable activity on our platform may require us to spend additional resources to prepare and defend against such threats, and could also increase the risk of retaliatory attack. In addition, we face the risk of cyber attacks and data exfiltration or compromise by nation-states and state-sponsored actors. These attacks may target us or our customers, particularly our public sector customers (including federal, state, and local governments). Geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and Ukraine, may increase these risks. 

We may experience security and privacy issues, whether due to employee or insider error or malfeasance, system errors, or vulnerabilities in our or other parties' systems. While we may not determine some of these issues to be material when they occur and may remedy them quickly, there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant legal, financial, and reputational harm, including government inquiries, enforcement actions, litigation, and negative publicity. There is also no guarantee that a series of related issues may not be determined to be material at a later date in the aggregate, even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, disable, or degrade service provided by or otherwise sabotage systems change frequently and often are recognized only after being launched against a target, even taking all reasonable precautions, including those required by law, we have been unable in the past and may continue to be unable to anticipate or detect certain attacks or vulnerabilities or implement adequate preventative measures. 

Further, if any partners with whom we share user or other customer information fail to implement adequate data-security practices, fail to comply with our terms and policies, or otherwise suffer a network or other security breach, our users' data may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed. If an actual or perceived breach of our or our business partners' or service providers' security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures would be harmed, we could lose users and customers, our trade secrets or those of our business partners may be compromised, and we may be exposed to significant legal and financial risks, including legal claims (which may include class-action litigation) and regulatory actions, fines, and penalties. Any of the foregoing consequences could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. 

While we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities, including dedicated worldwide incident response teams, our response process, particularly during times of a natural disaster or pandemic, may not be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not be fast enough to prevent or limit harm, or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident. As a result, we may suffer significant legal, reputational, or financial exposure, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.

Our ongoing investments in safety, security, and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of our platforms and misuse of user data. 

In addition to our efforts to prevent and mitigate cyber attacks, we are making significant investments in safety, security, and review efforts to combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access to user data by third parties, including investigation and review of platform applications that could access the information of users of our services. As a result of these efforts, we have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, incidents of unnecessary access to or misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. However, we may not have discovered, and may in the future not discover, all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data limitations, including our lack of visibility over our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, or other factors, including factors outside of our control such as a natural disaster or pandemic, and we may learn of such incidents or activity via third parties. Such incidents and activities may include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms, contracts, or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper ad purchases, activities that threaten people's safety on- or off-line, or instances of spamming, scraping, or spreading disinformation. While we may not determine some of these incidents to be material at the time they occurred and we may remedy them quickly, there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant legal, financial, and reputational harm, including government inquiries and enforcement actions, litigation, and negative publicity. There is also no guarantee that a series of related issues may not be determined to be material at a later date in the aggregate, even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence. 

We may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise prevent or remediate any such incidents. Any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation and brands, require us to change our business practices in ways that harm our business operations, and adversely affect our business and financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and

Alphabet Inc.

regulatory inquiries, which could result in monetary penalties and damages, divert management's time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight. 

Our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet access providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers. 

Our products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products require significant network capacity to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers have taken, or have stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings, or by providing our competitors preferential access. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet access providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists in the US and elsewhere regarding such protections. In addition, in some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject to government-initiated restrictions or blockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers, advertisers, and content providers, and impair our ability to attract new ones; harm our reputation; and increase costs, thereby negatively affecting our business. 

Risks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies 

We are subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could harm our business, and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue to expand our business. 

We are subject to numerous US federal and state as well as foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subjects, and our introduction of new businesses, products, services, and technologies will likely continue to subject us to additional laws and regulations. In recent years, governments around the world have proposed and adopted a large number of new laws and regulations relevant to the digital economy, particularly in the areas of data privacy and security, competition, AI, and online content. The costs of compliance with these measures are high and are likely to increase in the future, including as a result of differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations. 

New or changing laws and regulations, or interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a manner inconsistent with our interpretations of such laws and regulations or our practices, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, less useful products and services, altered business models and operations, limited ability to pursue certain business practices or offer certain products and services, substantial costs, and civil or criminal liability. Examples include laws and regulations regarding: 

•Competition and technology platforms' business practices: Laws and regulations focused on large technology platforms, including the Digital Markets Act in the European Union (EU) and the Act on Promotion of Competition for Specified Smartphone Software in Japan; regulations and legal settlements in the US, South Korea, and elsewhere that affect Google Play's billing policies, fees, and business model; as well as litigation and new and expected regulations in a range of jurisdictions.

•AI: Laws and regulations focused on the development, use, and provision of AI technologies and other digital products and services, which could result in monetary penalties or other regulatory actions. For example, the EU AI Act came into force on August 1, 2024, and will generally become fully applicable after a two-year transitional period (although certain obligations have already taken effect). The EU AI Act introduces various requirements for AI systems and models placed on the market in the EU, including specific transparency, safety, and copyright requirements for general purpose AI systems and the models on which those systems are based. Various countries, including Brazil, India, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Vietnam, have also enacted or are considering enacting regulations focused on AI. In the US, an increasing amount of legislative and regulatory activity regarding AI is taking place at the state level. In 2025, state legislatures considered more than 1,000 AI-related bills, including on fundamental model research and development, synthetic media, algorithmic decision-making, and many others, and took a variety of approaches to AI regulation. For instance, in 2025, California and New York passed the Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act and the Responsible AI Safety and Education Act, respectively, each of which imposes safety and reporting obligations on developers of frontier models. At the same time, the White House's Executive Order, Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence, prioritizes deregulation, while its AI Action Plan emphasizes accelerating American innovation leadership.

Alphabet Inc.

•Data privacy, collection, processing, and portability: Laws and regulations further restricting the collection, processing, or sharing of user or advertising-related data, including privacy and data protection laws; laws affecting the processing of children's data (as discussed further below), data breach notification laws; laws limiting data transfers (including data localization laws); laws limiting use of data for AI training; and laws requiring data portability. 

•Copyright and other intellectual property: Copyright and related laws, including the EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market and European Economic Area transpositions, which have introduced new licensing regimes, increase liability with respect to content uploaded by users or linked to from our platforms, or create property rights in news publications that could require payments to news agencies and publishers, which may result in other regulatory actions. The scope of the text and data mining exception is being challenged before courts in the EU, which could harm some aspects of our business. 

•Content moderation: Various laws covering content moderation and removal, and related disclosure obligations, such as the EU's Digital Services Act, Florida's Senate Bill 7072 and Texas' House Bill 20, and laws and proposed legislation in Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom (UK) that impose penalties for failure to remove certain types of content or require disclosure of information about the operation of our services and algorithms, which may make it harder for services like Google Search and YouTube to detect and limit low-quality, deceptive, or harmful content, or, on the other hand, may impinge on the rights of free expression and access to content. Additionally, new regulations apply to online child safety, including access and content restrictions as well as other limitations for minors, which may also conflict with rights of free expression and access to information. These regulations could result in our having to modify our products and services and monitor minors' experiences on our products and services.

•Consumer protection: Consumer protection laws, including the EU's New Deal for Consumers, which could result in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations.

In addition, the applicability and scope of these and other laws and regulations, as interpreted by courts, regulators, or administrative bodies, remain uncertain and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business. For example, we rely on statutory safe harbors, like those set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in the US and the Digital Services Act in Europe, to protect against liability for various linking, caching, ranking, recommending, and hosting activities. Legislation or court rulings affecting these safe harbors may harm us and may impose significant operational challenges. There are legislative proposals and pending litigation in the US, EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for websites and online platforms. Our development, use, and commercialization of AI products and services (including our implementation of AI in our offerings and internal systems) could subject us to regulatory action and legal liability, including under specific legislation regulating AI, as well as new applications of existing data protection, cybersecurity, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws.

Further, we are subject to evolving laws, regulations, policies, and international accords relating to matters beyond our core products and services, including environmental sustainability, climate change, human capital, and employment matters. In response, we have implemented robust programs and initiatives and adopted reporting frameworks and principles that may require considerable investments. For instance, AI's energy and water demands have made efforts to reduce our emissions more complex and challenging across every level. We cannot guarantee that our initiatives will be fully realized on the timelines we expect or at all, and projects that are completed as planned may not achieve the results we anticipate.

We are and may continue to be subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, enforcement actions, consent orders, and other forms of regulatory scrutiny and legal liability, including competition matters, that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

We are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings, and orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, design of our products and services, personal injury and other tort and nuisance theories, consumer protection claims, including how we moderate content on our platforms, AI, and other matters.

The US Department of Justice (DOJ), various states, and other plaintiffs have filed, and may continue to file in the future, several antitrust lawsuits about aspects of our business, including our advertising technologies and practices, the operation and distribution of Google Search, and the operation and distribution of Android operating system and Play Store. If we are unsuccessful in these lawsuits, we could face significant expenses to implement the remedies, and such costs and alterations could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

18.  


Alphabet Inc.

For example, the DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit concerning our Search and Search advertising practices and our compliance with US antitrust laws. In August 2024, the US District Court for the District of Columbia ruled against Google, and in December 2025, entered a final judgment requiring remedies, which, among other things, imposes restrictions on how we distribute our services and requires us to share certain search data with and offer syndication services to certain competitors. In January 2026, we appealed the final judgment and moved to pause implementation of certain remedies. In February 2026, the DOJ and state Attorneys General also appealed. 

Furthermore, in December 2020, a number of state Attorneys General, led by the Texas Attorney General, filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas concerning our advertising technology and our compliance with US antitrust laws and other laws. In January 2023, the DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General sued in the Eastern District of Virginia alleging similar antitrust violations relating to our advertising technology. In April 2025, the presiding judge issued a mixed decision in the DOJ case against us, ruling that neither our advertiser tools nor the DoubleClick and AdMeld acquisitions were anticompetitive, but that our publisher tools unfairly excluded rivals. A separate proceeding to determine remedies, the range of which varies widely, took place in September 2025 with the parties presenting differing remedy proposals. The DOJ's remedy proposal includes structural remedies that could harm our business. Closing arguments were held in November 2025, and we are awaiting a final judgment. After that judgment, we plan to appeal the adverse portion of the April 2025 decision and potentially aspects of the remedies decision. A trial in the state Attorneys General case in the Eastern District of Texas will take place after a decision on remedies is issued in the DOJ advertising technology case, and could result in remedies that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. 

In addition to these regulatory proceedings, private individual and collective actions that overlap with claims pursued by regulators are pending in the US and in several other jurisdictions. Adverse results in these or similar future lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages and remedies that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

Other regulatory agencies in the US and around the world, including competition enforcers, consumer protection agencies, and data protection authorities, have challenged and may continue to challenge our business practices and compliance with laws and regulations. We are cooperating with these investigations and defending litigation or appealing decisions where appropriate.

We are also subject to a variety of claims including product warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related to product defects, among other litigation, and we may also be subject to claims involving health and safety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental effects, AI training, development, and commercialization, or service disruptions or failures. Claims have been brought, and we expect will continue to be brought, against us for defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, patent, copyright, and trademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity, torts, privacy rights violations, fraud, or other legal theories based on the nature and content of information available on or via our services, the design and effect of our products and services, or due to our involvement in hosting, transmitting, marketing, branding, or providing access to content created by third parties.

Various laws, regulations, investigations, enforcement lawsuits, and regulatory actions have involved in the past, and may in the future result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, including divestiture, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences. Any of these legal proceedings could also result in legal costs, diversion of management resources, and negative publicity, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

Estimating liabilities for our pending proceedings is a complex, fact-specific, and speculative process that requires significant judgment, and the amounts we are ultimately liable for may differ from our estimates. The resolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in, and may in the future result in, additional substantial fines, penalties, injunctions, and other sanctions that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. 

For additional information about the ongoing material legal proceedings to which we are subject, see Legal Proceedings in Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Privacy, data protection, data usage, and portability regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas. Any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. 

Authorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection, data usage and portability, and encryption of user data. Additionally, the increasing adoption of AI technologies, which rely on the collection of large amounts of data and use of such data for training purposes, has led data protection authorities around the world to consider and adopt new and evolving interpretations 

19.  


Alphabet Inc.

of data protection laws, imposing specific obligations with respect to the processing of personal data, including required notices, consents, and opt-outs. Further, the increased risk of inadvertent disclosure of confidential information or personal data in connection with the utilization of AI technologies may result in stronger regulatory scrutiny, leading to legal and regulatory investigations and enforcement actions that could harm our business, even if unfounded. Adverse legal rulings, legislation, or regulation have resulted in, and may continue to result in, fines and orders requiring that we change our practices, which have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on how we provide services, harming our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and compliance obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs or harm the quality and operations of our products and services in ways that harm our business. Examples of these laws include: 

•The EU General Data Protection Regulation and the UK General Data Protection Regulations, which apply to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or the UK, respectively, or related to products and services that we offer to EU or the UK users or customers, respectively, or the monitoring of their behavior in the EU or the UK, respectively.

•Various US federal, US state, and foreign privacy laws related to the processing and security of personal data, including (1) comprehensive privacy laws that provide data privacy rights (including, in California, a private right of action in the event of a data breach resulting from our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices) and impose significant obligations on controllers and processors of consumer data; (2) laws imposing obligations on businesses that collect or disclose biometric information (including, in Colorado, Illinois, Texas, and Washington); (3) laws governing the collection and processing of children and minor's data and how companies provide age-appropriate online experiences (including, in the US, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998; the pending Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA 2.0); similar US state laws related to children's privacy, such as the New York Child Data Protection Act; and the UK's Age-Appropriate Design Code); and (4) laws regulating internet-connected devices (such as, in California, the Internet of Things Security Law).

•The EU's Digital Markets Act, which requires in-scope companies to obtain user consent for combining data across certain products and require search engines to share anonymized data with rival companies, among other changes; and the EU Data Act, which introduces new data portability requirements with respect to connected products (i.e., 'internet of things' products) and related services, as well as interoperability obligations on data processing services. 

Further, we are subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process, or receive personal data, as well as ongoing enforcement actions from supervisory authorities related to cross-border transfers of personal data. The validity of various data transfer mechanisms we currently rely upon remains subject to legal, regulatory, and political developments globally, which may require us to adapt our existing arrangements.

We face, and may continue to face, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, violation of rights of publicity, and other claims that could be costly to defend, result in significant damage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to use certain technologies. 

We, like other internet, technology, and media companies, are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights, including patent, copyright, trade secrets, and trademarks. Parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in US and international courts and the US International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease-and-desist orders. In addition, patent-holding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims against us. As we continue to expand our business, intellectual property claims against us have increased and may continue to increase as we develop and acquire new products, services, and technologies, including AI technologies. 

Adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the US or elsewhere, including by preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services in certain jurisdictions. They may also cause us to change our business practices in ways that could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. 

Many of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend against certain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could 

20.  


Alphabet Inc.

result in loss of revenues and harm our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from intellectual property infringement claims. Furthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual property claims. Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. To the extent such claims are successful, they could harm our business, including our product and service offerings, financial condition, and operating results. 

We could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new US or international tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities. 

We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the US and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates are affected by a variety of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates, net gains and losses on hedges and related transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, changes in our stock price for shares issued as employee compensation, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws). Further, if we are unable or fail to collect taxes on behalf of customers, employees, and partners as the withholding agent, we could become liable for taxes that are levied against third parties. 

We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result, we have received, and may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, on various tax-related assertions, such as transfer-pricing adjustments or permanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could harm our financial condition and operating results, require adverse changes to our business practices, or subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and often involves uncertainty. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. 

Further, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant changes in ways that could harm our financial condition and operating results. For example, various jurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering revenue-based taxes such as digital services taxes and other targeted taxes, which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax regimes. The US has imposed a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of shares repurchased, which could increase in the future. Over 140 countries are negotiating changes to international tax policies led by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), including a 15% global minimum tax rate. In January 2026, the OECD announced a "Side-by-Side Safe Harbor" that exempts US operations of US-parented companies from global minimum tax rules. Adoption of minimum tax rules outside the US could increase our effective tax rate and cash tax payments.

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Stock 

We cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program or dividend program will be continuously active or fully consummated or will enhance long-term stockholder value, and share repurchases or dividends could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could diminish our cash reserves.

We engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with authorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. Our cash dividend program pays regular cash dividends to our Class A, Class B, and Class C stockholders. Any and all future cash dividends are subject to declaration by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion, and in accordance with the requirements of any applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including the Delaware General Corporation Law. Our cash dividend program does not require, and our Board of Directors may decide not to declare, a cash dividend each quarter, and does not obligate our Board of Directors to declare a dividend at any specific dollar amount per share. Any such decision by our Board of Directors may depend on a variety of factors that it may deem relevant, including but not limited to our earnings, liquidity, financial condition, other capital deployment opportunities, level of indebtedness, and general market conditions. Our share repurchases and dividends could affect our share trading prices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock. 

The concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters. 

Our Class B stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A stock has one vote per share, and our Class C stock has no voting rights. As of December 31, 2025, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 89.3% of our 

21.  


Alphabet Inc.

outstanding Class B stock, which represented approximately 52.7% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Through their stock ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C stock carries no voting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C stock, including in future stock-based acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey's current relative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. The share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also affect Larry and Sergey's relative voting power. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, which could reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock. 

Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable. 

Provisions in Alphabet's certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following: 

•Our Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director.

•Our stockholders may not act by written consent, which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding a stockholders' meeting.

•Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates.

•Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of Directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders' meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company. 

•Our Board of Directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, which makes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us. 

As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the Board of Directors has approved the transaction. Our Board of Directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us. 

General Risks 

Our operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations. 

Our operating results have fluctuated, and may in the future fluctuate, as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control, including the cyclical nature and seasonality in our business and geopolitical events. As a result, comparing our operating results (including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues) on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance. Consequently, our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations. 

Acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other consequences that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. 

Acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results. We expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic arrangements, which could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Some of the areas where we face risks include: 

•diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and other strategic arrangements; 

•failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions placed upon approval, either of which could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, result in the payment of fees or penalties to a counterparty, or otherwise restrict our ability to 

22.  


Alphabet Inc.

realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction; or investigations or litigation by governmental authorities related to our acquisitions, investments, and other strategic arrangements;

•failure to successfully integrate the acquired operations, technologies, services, and personnel (including cultural integration and retention of employees) and further develop the acquired business or technology; 

•implementation of controls (or remediation of deficiencies), procedures, and policies at the acquired company; 

•integration of the acquired company's accounting and other administrative systems, and the coordination of product, engineering, and sales and marketing functions;

•transition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms;

•in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; 

•failure to accomplish commercial, strategic, or financial objectives with respect to investments, joint ventures, and other strategic arrangements;

•failure to realize the value of investments and joint ventures due to a lack of liquidity or an inability to identify buyers or negotiate favorable terms for intended divestitures;

•liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including intellectual property infringement claims, data privacy and security issues, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, warranty claims, product liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; and

•litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders, or other third parties.

Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and other strategic arrangements could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally. 

Our acquisitions and other strategic arrangements could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill or purchased long-lived assets, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm our financial condition and operating results. Also, the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions, investments, and other strategic arrangements may not materialize. In connection with our divestitures and certain strategic arrangements, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. 

We rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or maintain and continue to adapt our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow or operate effectively. 

Our performance and future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key technical leads as well as members of our senior management team. For instance, Sundar Pichai is critical to the overall management of Alphabet and its subsidiaries and plays an important role in the development of our technology, maintaining our culture, and setting our strategic direction. 

Our ability to compete effectively and our future success depend on our continuing to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees, particularly AI talent, is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted, and may continue to target, our employees. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Immigration policy and regulatory changes, and uncertainty regarding such policies and regulations, may also affect our ability to hire, mobilize, or retain some of our global talent. All of our executive officers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies.

We believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization grows and evolves, we may need to adapt our corporate culture and work environments to ever-changing circumstances, and these changes could affect our ability to compete effectively or have an adverse effect on our corporate culture.

Table of Contents

Alphabet Inc.

We maintain a comprehensive process for identifying, assessing, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats as part of our broader risk management system and processes. For example, some risks include our software supply chain and other third-party dependencies, vulnerabilities in our products and services, theft of our intellectual property, and attempts to compromise our infrastructure. We obtain input, as appropriate, for our cybersecurity risk management program on the security industry and threat trends from multiple external experts and internal threat intelligence teams. Teams of dedicated privacy, safety, and security professionals oversee cybersecurity risk management and mitigation, incident prevention, detection, and remediation. These teams comprise professionals with deep cybersecurity expertise across multiple industries and are led by our Vice President of Privacy, Safety, and Security, who has more than 20 years of experience, including roles in technology infrastructure for two other large public companies. Our executive leadership team, along with input from the above teams, are responsible for our overall enterprise risk management system and processes and regularly consider cybersecurity risks in the context of other material risks to the company.

As part of our cybersecurity risk management process, our incident management teams track and log privacy and security incidents across Alphabet, our vendors, and other third-party service providers to remediate and resolve any such incidents. Significant incidents are reviewed regularly by a cross-functional working group to determine whether further escalation is appropriate. Any incident assessed as potentially being or potentially becoming material is promptly escalated for further assessment, and then reported to designated members of our senior management. We consult with outside counsel as appropriate, including on materiality analysis and disclosure matters, and our senior management makes the final materiality determinations and disclosure and other compliance decisions. Our management apprises Alphabet’s independent public accounting firm of relevant matters and developments.

The Risk and Compliance Committee has oversight responsibility for risks and incidents relating to cybersecurity threats, including compliance with disclosure requirements, cooperation with law enforcement, and related effects on financial and other risks, and it reports any findings and recommendations, as appropriate, to the full Board for consideration. Senior management regularly discusses cybersecurity risks and trends and, should they arise, any material incidents with the Risk and Compliance Committee. Internal Audit maintains a dedicated cybersecurity auditing team that independently tests our cybersecurity controls. 

Our business strategy, results of operations and financial condition have not been materially affected by risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of previously identified cybersecurity incidents, but we cannot provide assurance that they will not be materially affected in the future by such risks or any future material incidents. For more information on our cybersecurity related risks, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
