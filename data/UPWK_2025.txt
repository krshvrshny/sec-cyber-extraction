Item 1A. Risk Factors.

A description of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business is set forth below. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as the other information in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below, or of additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.

Summary of Risk Factors

Some of the more material risks that we face include:

•Our growth depends on our ability to attract and retain a community of talent and clients, and the failure to maintain or grow our community of active customers in a cost-effective manner or at all could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. 

•We have experienced growth in recent periods and expect to invest in our growth in the future. If we are unable to maintain similar levels of growth or manage future growth, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

•We continue to evolve our business strategy, offerings and pricing models, and changes that we make can adversely affect our business and make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects.

•If we are unable to maintain our banking and payment partner relationships on favorable terms, or at all, our business could be adversely affected.

•Our business depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties and their continued performance.

•We face payment and fraud risks that could adversely impact our business.

•Customers circumvent our platforms and other workforce solutions, which adversely impacts our business.

•Issues relating to artificial intelligence and machine learning could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

•We are subject to disputes with or between our customers.

•We face risks related to our international community of customers, which could increase as we seek to expand our international footprint.

•Acquisitions, investments, and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and harm our business.

•If the market for independent talent and the services they offer does not grow, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

•If we are not able to develop and release new offerings and services or successful enhancements to our existing offerings and services, our business could be adversely affected.

•If internet search engines’ methodologies or other channels that we utilize to direct traffic to our websites are modified to our disadvantage, or our search result page rankings decline for other reasons, our customer growth could decline.

•We face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

•If we or our third-party partners experience a security breach, other hacking or phishing attack, ransomware or other malware attack, or other privacy or security incident, our platforms and other workforce solutions 

10

may be perceived as not being secure, our reputation may be harmed, demand for our offerings may be reduced, our operations may be disrupted, we may incur significant legal costs, fines, or liabilities, and our business could be adversely affected.

•If we fail to maintain and enhance our brands and reputation, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.

•Business or system errors, defects, or disruptions could diminish demand, adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition, and subject us to liability.

•Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Any failure to comply with the extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently changing laws and regulations, both in the United States and internationally, could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.

•We have a history of net losses, may increase our operating expenses in the future, and may not be able to sustain profitability.

•Our operating results and performance metrics may fluctuate from period to period, which makes our future results difficult to predict.

•The applicability of sales, use, and other tax laws or regulations on our business could subject us or our customers to additional tax liability and related interest and penalties, and adversely impact our business.

•We track certain performance metrics with internal tools and do not independently verify such metrics. Certain of our performance metrics may not accurately reflect certain details of our business, are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.

•The stock price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.

•We cannot guarantee that the 2025 Share Repurchase Authorization will be fully consummated or that share repurchases will enhance long-term stockholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our common stock and diminish our cash reserves.

•Our indebtedness could limit the cash flow available for our operations and expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

•Adverse or changing economic conditions may negatively impact our business.

Risks Related to our Business Operations, Execution, and Growth

Our growth depends on our ability to attract and retain a community of talent and clients, and the failure to maintain or grow our community of active customers in a cost-effective manner or at all could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.

The size of our community of customers, both talent and clients, is critical to our success. Our ability to achieve significant future revenue growth depends, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain customers.

Clients have diverse options to find and engage service providers, including other online or offline platforms, staffing firms and agencies, by engaging service providers directly, or by hiring temporary, full-time, or part-time employees directly or through an agency. Clients may decrease or cease their use of our platforms and other workforce solutions and our revenue may be adversely impacted for many reasons, including: if we fail to attract and retain talent; if the quality or types of services provided, or the pricing offered, by talent are not satisfactory to clients; or if AI tools provide a suitable replacement for traditional talent tasks. Further, expenditures by clients may be cyclical and may reflect overall macroeconomic conditions or budgeting patterns. The loss of a key client could have an adverse effect on our business. 

Talent similarly have many different ways of marketing their services, securing clients, and obtaining payments from clients, and the competition from offline and online models is significant. Likewise, there may be impediments to talent who would like to provide services to clients through our platforms and other workforce solutions.

Customers may stop using our platforms and other workforce solutions if the quality of the customer experience or our offerings or services do not meet their expectations or keep pace with the timing or quality of competitive products and services. Customers may also choose to cease using our platforms and other workforce solutions if they perceive that our pricing models are not in line with the value they derive from our offerings. Our efforts to attract and retain customers may not be successful or cost effective, and if customers, particularly significant clients, 

11

cease or reduce their use of our offerings and services for any reason, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected.

We have experienced growth in recent periods and expect to invest in our growth in the future. If we are unable to maintain similar levels of growth or manage future growth, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

We have experienced growth in a relatively short period of time and expect to invest in our growth in the future. However, our historical growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain our historical growth rates or that any future investments in growth will be successful or cost-effective. Moreover, sustaining our growth in future periods will become more difficult in periods of macroeconomic uncertainty, elevated interest rates, and inflation. To manage any future growth, we must improve our systems, motivate and effectively manage and train our workforce, and successfully manage the risks, challenges, and uncertainties associated with our business. If we are unable to grow successfully without compromising the quality of our offerings or customer experience, or if new systems that we implement to assist in managing our growth do not produce the expected benefits, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

We continue to evolve our business strategy, offerings and pricing models, and changes that we make can adversely affect our business and make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects.

We continue to evolve our business strategy, offerings, and pricing model, as well as our sales, marketing, and brand positioning efforts. We continuously evaluate and revise our current offerings and pricing model and create and test additional offerings, pricing models, features, and services to serve our current and prospective customer base. For example, in August 2025, we launched Lifted, our enterprise-focused subsidiary offering a broader range of contingent work solutions for large enterprises.

Changes in our offerings and pricing model and the continued evolution of our business strategy and brand positioning subject us to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for and project future growth and performance. Creating or modifying offerings is expensive and time consuming, diverts the attention of management, and may not be successful or cost-effective to maintain. In addition, we have in the past seen, and may in the future see, unexpected or unintended negative effects as a result of changes to our pricing model, offerings, and sales and marketing efforts, including increased customer dissatisfaction, harm to our reputation, increased circumvention rates, reductions in the number, size, or completion rate of client projects, or a failure to attract and retain customers. Additionally, implementing changes to business strategies could result in furloughs, layoffs, and reductions in force, such as our restructuring plan announced in October 2024, which we refer to as the Restructuring Plan. If there are unforeseen expenses associated with such realignments in our business strategies, and we incur unanticipated charges or liabilities, then we may not be able to effectively realize the expected cost savings or other benefits of such actions. Any negative impacts resulting from changes to our business strategy, offerings, or pricing model could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. 

If we are unable to maintain our banking and payment partner relationships on favorable terms, or at all, our business could be adversely affected.

We rely on banks and payment partners to provide us with corporate banking services, escrow trust accounts or other regulated accounts, and clearing, processing, and settlement functions for the funding of all transactions on our platforms and disbursement of funds to customers. Our banking and payment partners are critical to our business, and we may not always have a sufficient surplus of vendors in the event one or more relationships are terminated or interrupted for any reason. This could occur for a number of reasons, including the following:

•our partners may be unable to perform the services we require of them, including meeting processing speed and compliance standards;

•a failure by us to comply with our partners’ compliance standards, which could result in increased rates that they charge us or our customers or a reduction or termination in services or benefits that they provide, and any remediation efforts undertaken by us may be costly and time consuming;

•our partners may be subject to investigation, regulatory enforcement, or other proceedings that result in their inability or unwillingness to provide services to us or our unwillingness to continue to partner with them;

•our partners may be unable to effectively accommodate changing service needs; and

•our partners could experience instability, delays, limitations, or closures of their businesses, networks, partners, or systems.

12

In addition, we may be forced to cease doing business with certain partners if payment laws, regulations, or rules change or are interpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply.

If we are unable to maintain our agreements with current partners on favorable terms or at all, or if we are unable to enter into new agreements with new partners on favorable terms or at all, our ability to collect payments and disburse funds and our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected. 

Our business depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties and their continued performance.

To grow our business, we need to continue to establish and maintain relationships with third parties, such as staffing providers, software and technology vendors, and payment processing and disbursement providers. We also have several partnerships that enable us to integrate AI tools into the Upwork Marketplace aimed at improving customer experience and productivity. As our agreements with third-party partners terminate or expire, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on favorable terms or at all. Some of our strategic partners offer, or could offer, competing products and services or also work with our competitors. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that the parties with which we have strategic relationships will continue to offer the services for which we rely on them at economically reasonable terms or at all or devote the resources necessary to expand our reach, increase our distribution, or support an increased number of customers. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with third parties on favorable terms, these relationships are not successful in improving our business, or one or more of our partners materially changes its business, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely impacted.

We face payment and fraud risks that could adversely impact our business.

We expect that bad actors will continue to attempt to use our platforms to engage in unlawful or fraudulent conduct. This conduct may include unauthorized or fraudulent acquisition or use of data, money laundering, moving funds to regions or persons restricted by sanctions or export controls, terrorist financing, fraudulent sale of services, bribery, breaches of security, extortion or use of ransomware, distribution or creation of malware or viruses, and piracy or misuse of software and other copyrighted or trademarked content. 

Our controls relating to customer identity verification and authentication and fraud detection are complex, require continuous improvement, and may not be effective in detecting and preventing misconduct. Further, while we take steps to improve our trust and safety program through the use of algorithms and machine learning techniques, any required or inadvertent disclosure of our security techniques or new laws restricting our use of them may make our efforts to prevent fraud or the improper use of our platforms less effective and increase the risk of harm to our customers. If our controls are not effective, any of the following could result, each of which could harm our reputation, divert the attention of management, and adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition:

•we may be, and historically have been, held liable for the unauthorized use of credit or debit card details or other payment account information and required to return the funds at issue and pay a chargeback, return, or other fee. If our chargeback or return rate becomes excessive, card networks may require us to pay fines or other fees or engage in costly remediation efforts or cease doing business with us;

•the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which we refer to as the DFPI, or other regulators may require us to hold larger cash reserves or take other action with respect to our internet escrow license or other licensing regimes;

•customers may seek to hold us responsible for losses, lose confidence in and decrease use of our platforms and other workforce solutions, or publicize their negative experiences;

•law enforcement or administrative agencies could seek to hold us responsible for the conduct of or content posted by customers and impose fines and penalties, bring criminal action, or require us to change our business practices, and private actions or public enforcement may increase depending on interpretations of and possible changes to applicable laws;

•we may be subject to additional risk and liability exposure if employees or third-party service providers, including our independent team members, misappropriate or facilitate the fraudulent use of our or customer banking, payment, or other information; 

•if talent misstate their qualifications, identity or location, or produce insufficient or defective work product or work product with a harmful effect, clients or other third parties may seek to hold us responsible and may lose confidence in and decrease use of our platforms and other workforce solutions; and

13

•we may bring, and have in the past brought, claims against clients and other third parties for their misuse of our platforms.

Customers circumvent our platforms and other workforce solutions, which adversely impacts our business. 

Our business depends on customers transacting through our platforms and other workforce solutions. Despite our efforts to prevent them from doing so, customers circumvent our platforms and other workforce solutions and engage with or take payment through other means to avoid fees, and it is difficult or impossible to measure the losses associated with circumvention. Enhancements and changes we make to our pricing models, fees, offerings, services, and features may unintentionally cause customers to circumvent our platforms and other workforce solutions. In addition, circumvention is likely to increase during a macroeconomic downturn, as customers may be more cost-sensitive. The loss of revenue associated with circumvention adversely impacts our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, our efforts to reduce circumvention may be costly or disruptive to implement, fail to have the intended effect or have an adverse effect on our brand or customer experience, reduce the attractiveness of our platforms and other workforce solutions, or otherwise harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Issues relating to artificial intelligence and machine learning could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We incorporate AI and machine learning technologies across our platforms, offerings, and internal operations and are making further investments in expanding our AI capabilities. In addition, GSV from AI-related work performed on the Upwork Marketplace has increased as demand for AI talent has grown in recent periods. As with many innovations, AI presents new and evolving risks and challenges that could undermine or slow its adoption or cause us to experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, legal liability, new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, and to incur additional costs to resolve such issues, each of which could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. For example, AI outputs may be, or alleged to be, deficient, inaccurate, inappropriate, biased, or infringing on the intellectual property rights of third parties. Perceived or actual technical, legal, compliance, privacy, security, ethical, or other issues relating to the use of AI may cause public confidence in AI generally or in our use of AI to be undermined, which could slow our customers’ adoption of our offerings, services, and features that use AI or result in a decrease in demand for AI-related work. In addition, the rapid evolution of AI will require significant resources to develop, integrate, and maintain the AI technologies included in our offerings, services, and features in order to remain competitive and to implement these technologies responsibly and minimize unintended or harmful impacts. There can be no assurance that the development and deployment of such technologies will be successful or cost effective.

We are subject to disputes with or between our customers.

Disputes sometimes arise between talent and clients, including with respect to service standards, payment, confidentiality, work product, and intellectual property ownership and infringement. If either party believes the contract terms were not met, the service agreements negotiated between our customers and our default terms provide a mechanism for the parties to request assistance from us and, for some contracts, a third-party arbitrator. If customer disputes are not resolved amicably, the parties might escalate to formal proceedings. Given our role in facilitating and supporting customers’ interactions, claims may be brought against us directly and talent or clients may bring us into claims filed against each other, particularly when one party is insolvent or facing financial difficulties. We generally disclaim responsibility and liability for disputes between customers; however, we cannot guarantee that these disclaimers will be effective in preventing or limiting our involvement in customer disputes, enforceable, or otherwise effectively prevent us from incurring liability. Disputes with or between customers may become more frequent based on the services offered or conditions outside our control, such as a macroeconomic downturn or actions of bad actors seeking to take advantage of other customers. Such disputes, or any increase in the number of disputes, may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We face risks related to our international community of customers, which could increase as we seek to expand our international footprint.

We have customers located in over 180 countries. Conducting business with an international customer base, engaging talent globally, and expanding our operations internationally subject us to significant challenges, uncertainties, and risks, including:

•varying and overlapping laws and regulations and approaches to enforcement, including with respect to worker classification and data protection and privacy;

14

•difficulties in, and costs of, establishing local brand recognition, adverse changes in customer sentiment between the United States and other countries, and staffing, managing, and operating international operations or support functions;

•the imposition of taxes on transactions between us and our customers or among our customers, or liability for failing to collect and remit taxes owed by our customers;

•compliance with laws designed to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities;

•tariffs, restrictions or fees applied to service exports and imports, restrictions on foreign investments, sanctions, changes to existing trade arrangements between various countries, and other trade barriers or protection measures;

•geopolitical instability and security risks, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, political instability, human rights concerns, terrorist activity, ransomware, and cyberterrorism in countries where we have customers and retaliatory actions that governments may take in response, including the interruption of internet access as a result of any of the foregoing;

•costs of localizing services and business practices, including adding the ability for clients to pay in local currencies or modifying our platforms to offer our websites in local languages;

•changes to laws, regulations, or central bank rules impacting us or our partners that may make payments for services exports more costly, difficult, or impossible to process, or that may reduce the availability of tools like digital wallets and related payment services;

•any unenforceability of contractual provisions designed to protect and mitigate against risks, including terms of service, services agreements, arbitration and class action waiver provisions, disclaimers of warranties, limitations of liabilities, releases of claims, and indemnification provisions;

•economic weakness or currency-related challenges or crises;

•regional or global public health events; 

•difficulties in obtaining and protecting our intellectual property rights outside the United States;

•organizing or similar activity by workers, local unions, works councils, or other labor organizations; and

•other risks relating to laws and regulations in jurisdictions outside the United States, as discussed elsewhere in these “Risk Factors.”

These risks may make it costly or difficult for us to conduct or expand our operations internationally, particularly in markets where we have limited experience. If we are unable to manage the complexity of global operations and support an international customer base successfully and in a cost-effective manner, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Our business depends largely on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, including senior management and key personnel. If we lose the services of Hayden Brown, our President and Chief Executive Officer, or other members of our senior management team or key personnel, we may not be able to execute on our business strategy.

Our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate our senior management and other key personnel. In particular, we are dependent on the services of Hayden Brown, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and our future vision, strategic direction, platforms, offerings, and technology could be compromised if she were to take another position, become ill or incapacitated, or otherwise become unable to serve as our President and Chief Executive Officer.

We face intense competition for qualified personnel from numerous technology companies. We may not be able to retain our current key personnel or attract, train, integrate, or retain other highly skilled personnel in the future and may incur significant costs to do so. Our senior management and other key personnel are all employed on an at-will basis, which means that they could terminate their employment with us at any time, for any reason, and without notice, and we do not maintain any “key-person” life insurance policies. In addition, changes in our management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives and other personnel changes including reorganizations of reporting lines of our workforce have resulted, and may in the future result, in increased attrition or reduced productivity of our personnel and could negatively impact our ability to attract qualified personnel. Volatility, depreciation, or lack of appreciation in our stock price may also affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel.

15

If we lose the services of senior management or other key personnel, if our succession plans prove inadequate to ensure business continuity, or if we are unable to retain, attract, train, and integrate the highly skilled personnel we need, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Acquisitions, investments, and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and harm our business.

Our business strategy may, from time to time, include business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions of products, services, technologies, businesses, or other assets, strategic investments, and commercial and strategic partnerships. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating and consummating strategic transaction opportunities. These transactions, even if undertaken and announced, may not close on the anticipated timeline or at all, including due to challenges in obtaining regulatory or other approvals. In addition, strategic transactions that do close may involve significant challenges, uncertainties, and risks, including:

•the potential for our strategic transactions to use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business or result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or the incurrence of significant indebtedness;

•failure of the strategic transaction to advance our business strategy or realize its anticipated benefits;

•disruptions of our ongoing operations and diversion of management’s attention;

•potential exposure to new or incremental risks associated with the acquired businesses or assets, including becoming subject to different laws and regulations or more stringent scrutiny due to the nature or location of the acquired business, products, technologies, or other assets;

•incurring substantial expenses or assuming substantial liabilities, ongoing obligations, or other risks, particularly if we fail to identify or accurately estimate commitments, liabilities, deficiencies, or other risks associated with the acquired businesses or assets;

•difficulties retaining key personnel of the acquired company or integrating acquired operations, products, systems, technologies, and employee cultures;

•potential exposure to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation, impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, or deferred compensation charges; or

•difficulties related to being required to adopt or modify accounting policies.

Strategic transactions are inherently risky, may not be successful, and may harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Risks Related to Our Industry, Offerings, and Services

If the market for independent talent and the services they offer does not grow, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. 

The Upwork Marketplace connects businesses with on-demand access to highly skilled independent talent worldwide. The market for online independent talent and the services they offer is relatively new, rapidly evolving, and unproven, and it is difficult to predict the size, growth rate, and expansion of this market. Our future success will depend in large part on the continued growth and expansion of this market. The overall demand for independent talent will continue to be impacted by competition in the marketplace, technological developments (including AI), and macroeconomic, geopolitical, legal, and regulatory conditions. In addition, many businesses may be unwilling to engage independent talent for a variety of reasons, including perceived negative connotations with outsourcing work, quality of work, fraud, privacy, or data security concerns, or the rapidly evolving regulation of independent contractor services more generally, as discussed elsewhere in these “Risk Factors.” Similarly, with the increased prevalence of remote work and increased flexibility in employment relationships in recent years, more skilled independent talent may choose traditional employment, reducing the number of qualified or desirable talent available on the Upwork Marketplace. If the market for independent talent and the services they offer does not grow, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

If we are not able to develop and release new offerings and services or successful enhancements to our existing offerings and services, our business could be adversely affected.

The market for contingent work is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product and service introductions and enhancements, changing customer demands, and evolving industry standards. We invest substantial resources in researching and developing new offerings and services and enhancing our platforms and other workforce solutions by incorporating additional features, improving functionality, modernizing our technology, 

16

and adding other improvements to meet our customers’ evolving demands in our increasingly highly competitive industry. For example, in August 2025, we launched Lifted, our enterprise-focused subsidiary offering a broader range of contingent work solutions for large enterprises, and we continue to invest in its development. The success of any enhancements to our platforms and other workforce solutions or any new offerings or services depends on several factors, including overall demand and market acceptance, competitive pricing, adequate quality testing, integration with our platforms and third-party partners’ technologies, and timely completion. We cannot be sure that we will succeed in delivering enhancements or any new offerings or services or that any enhancements or new offerings or services will be successful or cost effective. Even if we do introduce new offerings or services, we may experience a decline in revenue from our existing offerings that is not offset by revenue from the new offerings or services, and we may experience unintended negative effects from any modifications to our existing offerings, services, and features, including reduced client spend, diminished fill rates for client projects, errors and disruptions on our platforms, and customer dissatisfaction.

If internet search engines’ methodologies or other channels that we utilize to direct traffic to our websites are modified to our disadvantage, or our search result page rankings decline for other reasons, our customer growth could decline.

We depend in part on internet search engines and other channels to direct a significant amount of traffic to our websites and mobile applications. Our ability to maintain the number of visitors directed to our websites and mobile applications is not entirely within our control. For example, our competitors’ search engine optimization and other efforts such as paid search may result in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than ours, or we may make changes to our websites or mobile applications that adversely impact our search engine optimization rankings and traffic to comply with requirements imposed by regulators, our vendors or third-party partners, or for other reasons. As a result, links to our websites may not be prominent enough to drive sufficient traffic to our websites, and we may not be able to influence search engine results.

In addition, search engines and other channels that we use to drive customers to our websites and mobile applications periodically change their algorithms, policies, and technologies, sometimes in ways that cause traffic to our websites and mobile applications to decline. These changes can also result in an interruption in customers’ ability to access our websites or a misunderstanding among potential customers regarding the functionalities or purposes of our platforms. We may also be forced to significantly increase marketing expenditures in the event that market prices for online advertising and paid listings escalate or our organic ranking decreases. Any of these changes could have an adverse impact on our customer acquisition, business, operating results, and financial condition.

We face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

The market for contingent talent and the clients that engage them is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting needs, and frequent introductions of new competitors as well as new offerings and services. We compete with a number of online and offline platforms and services domestically and internationally, as well as traditional staffing firms. Our main competitors fall into the following categories:

•traditional contingent workforce and staffing service providers and other outsourcing providers, such as The Adecco Group, Randstad, Recruit, Allegis Group, and Robert Half International;

•online freelancer platforms that serve either a diverse range of skill categories, such as Fiverr, Guru, and Freelancer.com, or specific skill categories;

•other online providers of products and services for individuals or businesses seeking work or to advertise their services, including personal and professional social networks, employment marketplaces, platforms providing compliance services, recruiting websites, and project-based deliverable providers;

•software and business services companies focused on talent acquisition, management, invoicing, or staffing management products and services;

•payment businesses that can facilitate payments to and from businesses and service providers;

•businesses that provide specialized professional services, including consulting, accounting, marketing, and information technology services; and

•online and offline job boards, classified ads, and other traditional means of finding work and service providers.

17

In addition, well-established internet companies, social media platforms, and businesses that operate driving, delivery, and other commoditized marketplaces, have entered or may decide to enter our market segment.

We also compete with companies that utilize emerging technologies and assets, such as AI and machine learning, blockchain, augmented reality, and cryptocurrency, to provide automated alternatives to the talent available through our platforms and other workforce solutions, connect businesses with service providers, or otherwise change the way that businesses engage or pay service providers or that service providers perform work.

Internationally, we compete against localized competitors that have greater brand recognition in other countries and a stronger understanding of local or regional culture and commerce. Some competitors also offer their products and services in local languages and currencies that we do not offer.

Many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as: greater name recognition and brand reputation; pre-existing relationships with desirable clients; more experience with international operations and localization of their offerings; longer operating histories; greater financial, technical, and other resources; more customers; newer technologies; and, in some cases, the ability to rapidly combine online platforms with traditional staffing and contingent worker solutions. These companies may use these advantages to offer products and services similar to ours at a lower price, develop competitive products, or respond more quickly and effectively than we do to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, regulatory conditions, or customer preferences or requirements. In addition, in developing technology markets subject to dynamic and rapid technological change, varied business models, and frequent disruption by innovative online and offline entrants, businesses can easily and quickly launch online or mobile platforms and applications at nominal cost by using commercially available software or partnering with various established companies. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, in which case our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely impacted.

If we or our third-party partners experience a security breach, other hacking or phishing attack, ransomware or other malware attack, or other privacy or security incident, our platforms and other workforce solutions may be perceived as not being secure, our reputation may be harmed, demand for our offerings may be reduced, our operations may be disrupted, we may incur significant legal costs, fines, or liabilities, and our business could be adversely affected.

Our business involves the storage, processing, and transmission of customers’ proprietary, confidential, and personal information by us and our third-party partners and vendors. Our third-party partners and vendors also process certain proprietary and confidential information relating to our business and personal information of our personnel. Our systems, and the systems of our vendors and third-party partners, may be vulnerable to privacy or security incidents, such as computer viruses and other malicious software, physical or electronic break-ins, or vulnerabilities resulting from intentional or unintentional service provider actions, and similar disruptions that could make all or portions of our websites or applications unavailable for periods of time. Additionally, ransomware or other malware, viruses, social engineering (including business email compromise and related wire-transfer fraud), impersonation of our company and executives on social media, and general hacking in our industry have become more prevalent and more complex. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not foreseeable or recognized until launched against a target, we and our vendors and third-party partners may be unable to anticipate incidents or to implement adequate preventative measures. Data security breaches and other privacy and security incidents may also result from non-technical means, such as actions taken by employees or other service providers.

Any privacy or security incident experienced by us, our vendors, or our third-party partners could result in: unauthorized access to, misuse of, or unauthorized acquisition of our, our personnel’s, or our customers’ data; the loss, corruption, or alteration of data; interruptions in our operations; or damage to our computers or systems or those of our customers. Any of these could expose us to claims, litigation, fines, enforcement actions, other potential liability, and reputational harm. In addition, significant unavailability of our platforms and other workforce solutions due to security breaches or other privacy and security incidents could cause customers to decrease or cease their use of our platforms and other workforce solutions. Any of these effects could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We may also need to expend significant resources to protect against or remediate security breaches and other incidents. We cannot be certain that our cyber liability insurance coverage will extend to or be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, at coverage limits we deem prudent, or at all. 

18

Depending on the nature of the information compromised, in the event of a security breach or other privacy or security incident, we may also have obligations to notify affected individuals and entities and regulators and provide remedy, such as credit monitoring services. We may also face significant fines, reimbursement obligations, or class-action settlements (including under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which we refer to as the CCPA). Breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent between jurisdictions. Complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs and harm our reputation.

If we fail to maintain and enhance our brands and reputation, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.

The awareness and integrity of our brands and reputation are important to achieving widespread acceptance and use of our platforms and other workforce solutions and attracting and retaining customers. Successful and efficient promotion and positioning of our brands and businesses depend on, among other things, the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and brand messaging and our ability to provide reliable, trustworthy, and useful platforms and other workforce solutions at competitive prices. Our marketing programs may not be successful or cost effective, particularly during early phases of new offerings or expansion into new segments or lines of business, such as the launch of Lifted. Additionally, as more jurisdictions adopt expansive data privacy regulations, an increasing number of customers and website visitors will have the right to opt-out of sharing their personal information for purposes of specific types of online advertising. This may lead to diminished efficacy of our marketing and brand positioning efforts, diminished visitor-to-customer conversions, and increased costs of maintaining compliance. Further, any negative publicity and news coverage relating to us, fraud or other illegal activity conducted by bad actors on our platforms or other workforce solutions, or decisions we make relating to geopolitical or social matters may undermine our brand promotion efforts or harm our reputation. If we fail to promote and maintain our brands successfully, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.

Business or system errors, defects, or disruptions could diminish demand, adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition, and subject us to liability.

Our systems and operations and those of our customers and third-party service providers and partners have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future, errors, defects, and disruptions from a variety of causes, including undetected hardware and software errors or defects, natural disasters such as an earthquake, blizzard, hurricane, fire, or flood, and other catastrophic events, including public health events and pandemics, man-made problems such as warfare or terrorism, human error, cybersecurity attacks, power losses, telecommunications or other technological failures, and similar events or circumstances. In particular, catastrophic events in geographical areas where our employees or customers are concentrated could have more severe impacts on our business, and the effects of climate change may increase the frequency and intensity of such events. For example, our corporate headquarters and many key personnel are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity and catastrophic fires.

As we expand, we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure and continued infrastructure modernization, including network capacity, computing power, and improvements to how we process and store data and transaction information. We also rely on third-party service providers and infrastructure, including the internet, to provide our platforms and other workforce solutions. For example, we currently host the Upwork Marketplace, serve its customers, and support its operations using AWS, a provider of cloud infrastructure services. We do not have control over the operations or the facilities of our third-party service providers, which are subject to risks of errors, defects, and disruptions. In addition, these third parties generally do not have an obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and we may not be able to switch to another third-party service provider easily or without incremental costs. Any interruption in the provision of services to us by these third parties for any reason or other unanticipated problems could result in interruptions to our platforms and other workforce solutions, and our and these third parties’ business continuity and disaster recovery plans may prove to be inadequate.

Our platforms enable customers to manage important aspects of their businesses, and any errors, defects, disruptions in service, or other performance or availability problems with our platforms or other workforce solutions, or our inability to adequately prevent or timely detect or remedy errors, defects, or disruptions in service, could harm our brands and reputation, result in security breaches or the loss of critical data, adversely impact our business and our customers, impair or jeopardize our partner relationships, result in delays in invoicing of clients or payment to us or talent, negatively impact our ability to obtain or maintain important licenses, or result in claims by customers for losses sustained by them or investigation or corrective action by regulatory agencies. In any such event, we may expend additional resources to attempt to resolve the issue. Moreover, we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to cover losses that may occur as a result of any such events, and we cannot be certain that 

19

insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Accordingly, any errors, defects, or disruptions in our platforms or other workforce solutions could diminish demand, subject us to liability, and adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Our ability to attract and retain customers depends in part on the quality of our customer support, and any failure to offer high-quality support could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Our ability to attract and retain customers is dependent in part on the ease of use, trustworthiness, and reliability of our platforms and other workforce solutions, including our ability to provide high-quality support. Our customers depend on our support organization to enforce our terms of service against bad actors, resolve any issues relating to our platforms and other workforce solutions, communicate effectively about their accounts, and assist in their use of our platforms and other workforce solutions, especially large clients, which expect higher levels of support. In addition, customers of our Enterprise business’s Managed Services offering depend on its support organization to manage their projects and reach satisfactory project outcomes. Our ability to provide effective support is largely dependent on our ability to attract, resource, and retain service providers who are both qualified and well versed in our business. The incorporation of AI into our support tools, either by us or our third-party support partners, may lead to inconsistent quality of experience as these tools are integrated and refined. As we seek to continue to grow our international customer base, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with delivering support and documentation in additional languages. Any failure to maintain high-quality support or effectively communicate with our customers, or any market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support or act professionally, fairly, or effectively in our communications and actions, could harm our reputation and customer demand, and adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Our customer growth and engagement on mobile devices depend upon third parties maintaining open application marketplaces and effective operation with mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control.

A significant and growing portion of our customers access our platforms through mobile devices and applications. Our mobile applications rely on third-party open application store platforms, including the Apple App Store and Google Play, which may change their policies, impose additional fees or requirements to support our applications, or stop supporting our applications altogether. These changes may increase our costs or adversely affect customer experience. Additionally, mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, could stop supporting our platforms or the ability to make payments on our platforms at all or on commercially reasonable terms or make changes that degrade the customer experience on our platforms. To deliver high-quality mobile offerings, it is important that our offerings are designed effectively and work well with a range of mobile devices, technologies, systems, networks, and standards that are beyond our control. In the event that it is inconvenient or impossible for our customers to access and use our platforms on their mobile devices or our competitors develop offerings and services that are perceived to operate more effectively on mobile devices, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely impacted.

Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters

Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Any failure to comply with the extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently changing laws and regulations, both in the United States and internationally, could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We and our customers are subject to a wide variety of foreign and domestic laws and regulations governing issues that may affect our business, including worker classification, employment, worker health, payments, worker confidentiality obligations and whistleblowing, intellectual property, consumer protection, taxation, privacy, and data security. These laws and regulations are often complex and subject to varying and evolving interpretations, resulting in shifting enforcement and application over time. Many of these laws were adopted prior to certain technological developments and do not contemplate or address the unique issues of such technologies. At the same time, regulatory scrutiny on large companies, technology companies, and companies engaged in dealings with independent contractors, payments, or personal information and data has increased significantly and may continue to increase. 

New and existing laws and regulations (or changes in interpretation of existing laws and regulations) may be adopted, implemented, or interpreted to apply to our business or our customers, including as a result of new lines of business, products or features we may introduce or international expansion of our business. In addition, these laws and regulations affect our customers and may affect demand for our platforms and other workforce solutions. If we determine additional legal or regulatory requirements apply to our business, we may expend resources to comply or 

20

obtain licenses, and such efforts may delay the launch of new offerings or features, distract management, or require adverse changes to the manner in which we conduct our business and may themselves cause regulatory agencies to scrutinize our business, including past practices. It is also possible that certain provisions in agreements with our customers or service providers, or between talent and clients, or the fees we charge, may be found to be unenforceable or not compliant with applicable law.

In addition, because our websites are generally accessible by customers worldwide, we have received and may continue to receive notices from jurisdictions claiming that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws and regulations. Laws and regulations outside of the United States that could be interpreted to apply to our business often provide greater rights to competitors, customers, and other third parties than those in the United States. Compliance with international laws and regulations may be more costly than expected, may require us to change our business practices or restrict or modify our offerings or obtain certain licenses, and such changes or licensure may not be possible on a reasonable timeline or at all. As a result, the imposition of any such laws or regulations on us, our customers, or third parties that we or our customers utilize to provide or use our services, may adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, we may be subject to multiple complex overlapping legal or regulatory regimes that impose conflicting requirements, including with respect to data protection and privacy, which could lead to additional compliance costs and enhanced legal risks.

Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to analyze and support compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will maintain compliance, that our interpretations are or will remain correct, or that all of our employees, contractors, partners, customers, and agents will comply. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to administrative inquiries and audits concerning our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including the taxation and classification of our workers and customers. Any failure or alleged failure by us or our employees, contractors, partners, customers, or agents to comply with applicable laws and regulations creates risk for our business and our employees, partners, contractors, and customers and could result in enforcement actions or other proceedings, criminal or civil fines and penalties or other actions, civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, the limitation or suspension of our ability to operate our business or certain services in a particular jurisdiction, damages, interest, loss of export privileges, costs and fees (including legal fees), injunctions, loss of intellectual property rights, whistleblower complaints, termination of agreements by our partners, the diversion of management’s attention and resources, or reputational harm and adverse media coverage. Certain of these claims may not be covered by our insurance, and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will cover liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, harm our reputation, reduce demand for our platforms and other workforce solutions, and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, and we could be required to make costly and burdensome changes to our business practices or compliance programs.

Worker Classification

Our clients are generally responsible for properly classifying the talent they engage through the Upwork Marketplace. Some clients opt to classify talent as employees for certain work, while talent in many other cases are classified as independent contractors. We also use the Upwork Marketplace to find and engage talent to provide services for us and for our outcomes-based delivery offerings, which may result in disputes or claims from such talent arising from the services performed or the working relationship.

We offer an optional service to customers of our premium offerings through which Lifted helps classify talent as employees of its subsidiaries or third-party staffing providers or as independent contractors. For clients of these services, subject to applicable law and the terms of our agreement with the client, we indemnify clients from misclassification risk and make certain warranties to the client, such as to compliance with applicable laws. In addition, we offer other premium offerings where we provide increased assistance to customers to find and contract with one another, which could increase employment-related risks. The failure of staffing providers that employ talent classified as employees to comply with all legal and tax requirements could adversely affect our business.

There is significant uncertainty and unpredictability in the worker classification regulatory landscape and the application of worker classification laws, which are highly fact-sensitive, subject to divergent interpretations by various authorities, and regularly subject to further regulation, amendment, or re-interpretation. As a result, there is risk to us and our customers that independent contractors could be deemed to be misclassified under applicable law, including as a result of changes in our offerings or brand positioning that we may introduce. For example, in California, Assembly Bill 5 is widely viewed as expanding the scope of the definition of “employee” for most purposes under California law. However, following the law’s effectiveness in January 2020 and subsequent amendments and challenges, there is little guidance from the courts or the regulatory authorities charged with its 

21

enforcement and there remains a degree of uncertainty regarding its application. Further, in January 2024, the U.S. Department of Labor published a final rule regarding the classification of workers as independent contractors or employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act. This rule is currently under reconsideration by the U.S. Department of Labor, and the continued regulatory uncertainty may contribute to confusion and complicate compliance efforts for our customers. Other federal agencies, U.S. states, or jurisdictions outside the United States may enact similar legislation or rules. 

Even if any new regulations do not directly impact our business, public perception may result in confusion about the standards to be applied when making an employment determination and cause clients to explore alternative arrangements to meet their talent needs. In addition, any developments or changes in the regulatory environment impacting worker classification and independent contractors may reduce the demand for independent contractors in one or more jurisdictions and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Privacy and Data Protection

We receive, collect, store, process, transfer, and use personal information and other customer data. There are numerous federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, information security, and the collection, storing, sharing, use, processing, transfer, disclosure, and protection of personal information and other data. We are also subject to the terms of our privacy policies and legal and contractual obligations to third parties related to privacy, data protection, and information security. The regulatory framework for privacy and data protection worldwide is uncertain and complex, and it is possible that the laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that we do not anticipate, that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another, or that conflicts with other rules or our practices. 

We expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, automated processing, and information security. For example, Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation, which we refer to as the GDPR, the UK General Data Protection Regulation, and Europe’s Digital Services Act impose stringent data protection and data handling compliance requirements and provide for significant penalties for noncompliance. In California, the CCPA, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, requires, among other things, covered companies to provide certain disclosures to California consumers and affords such consumers certain rights, including the right to opt-out of certain sales of personal data. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. A growing number of U.S. states have enacted similar or other data protection legislation that have or will go into staggered effect in the near future, and several other states and countries are considering expanding or passing privacy laws in the near term.

The enactment of more restrictive laws, rules, or regulations, the loss of existing cross-border data transfer frameworks such as the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, or future enforcement actions or investigations could increase our costs, require us to materially modify our services and features, which we may be unable to complete in a cost-effective manner, or at all, and may limit our ability to store and process customer data or develop new services and features, any of which could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Artificial Intelligence

The legal and regulatory landscape surrounding AI technologies is rapidly evolving and uncertain, including in the areas of consumer protection, intellectual property, cybersecurity, and privacy and data protection. Compliance with new and emerging laws, regulations, or industry standards relating to AI in the United States and internationally, such as U.S. state regulations and the E.U. AI Act, may impose significant operational costs and may limit our, our vendors’, or our customers’ ability to develop, deploy, or use existing or future AI technologies. As a result, our ability to adapt our existing platforms and offerings or develop new offerings, services, and features using AI may be limited or restricted and demand for AI-related work may decline, which could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Payments

We maintain a subsidiary licensed as an internet escrow agent under California’s Escrow Law that is subject to regulations applicable to internet escrow agents promulgated by the DFPI. Although we believe that our operations comply with existing U.S. federal, state, and international laws and regulatory requirements related to escrow, generating interest from customer funds held in escrow, money transmission, and the handling or moving of money, developments in the laws and regulations or their interpretations, and changes in our operations and offerings may result in the application of new or different regulatory requirements to our business. As a result, we could be required, or choose, to become licensed as an escrow agent or a money transmitter (or other similar licensee) in other states or jurisdictions or as a money services business. It is also possible that we could become subject to 

22

regulatory enforcement or other proceedings in states or other jurisdictions with escrow, money transmission, electronic money, or other similar statutes or regulatory requirements related to the handling, storing, or moving of money, and such risk may increase if we are required or choose to pursue additional or different licenses, which could in turn have a significant impact on our business. We may also be required, or choose, to become licensed as a payment institution (or obtain a similar license) under the European Payment Services Directive or other international laws and regulations or may choose to obtain such a license even if not required or to support new products or services. 

Any developments in the laws or regulations related to escrow, money transmission, or the handling, storing, or moving of money; material changes to the mandate, purview or regulatory approach at the DFPI; or increased scrutiny of our business may lead to additional compliance costs and administrative overhead. Moreover, to the extent that holding or pursuing escrow, money transmitter, or similar licenses involves complying with other regulatory frameworks, such as GDPR or CCPA, we may experience increased enforcement or other proceedings.

Anti-Corruption, Anti-Money Laundering, and Sanctions

We have voluntarily implemented an anti-money laundering compliance program designed to address the risk of our platforms and other workforce solutions being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, or other illegal activity. However, our program may not be sufficient to prevent our platforms and other workforce solutions from being used to improperly move money or may not satisfy the expectations of our partners or regulators.

We also have policies, procedures, and technology designed to allow us to comply with U.S. economic sanctions laws and prevent our platforms and other workforce solutions from being used to facilitate business in countries, regions, or with persons or entities included on designated lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which we refer to as OFAC, and equivalent foreign authorities. Our efforts to comply with OFAC regulations may not be effective, our partners or regulators may determine they are insufficient, or we may be required to comply with new sanctions laws and regulations, which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program. Given the technical limitations in developing controls to prevent, among other things, the ability of customers to publish on our platforms false or deliberately misleading information or to develop sanctions-evasion methods, it is possible that we may inadvertently and unknowingly provide services to individuals or entities that are subject to sanctions or are located in a country subject to an embargo.

We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which we refer to as the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the U.S. Travel Act, and the UK Bribery Act 2010, and may be subject to other anti-bribery laws in countries in which we conduct activities or have customers. We face significant risks if we fail to comply with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws. Local customs in international jurisdictions may involve practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other applicable laws and regulations. We may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities, and we may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we prohibit or do not explicitly authorize such activities. We have implemented an anti-corruption compliance policy, but we cannot ensure that all of our employees, contractors, customers, and agents will comply with our policy and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible.

Even if we maintain proper controls and remain in compliance with applicable anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, and sanctions laws or regulations, should any of our competitors not implement sufficient controls and be found to have violated such laws or regulations, customer perception of contingent work platforms in general may decrease and our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.

Export Controls

We may be subject to export controls and similar regulations that prohibit the shipment or provision of certain products and services to certain countries, governments, and persons, and new export controls and similar regulations are promulgated from time to time. While we take precautions to prevent aspects of our platforms from being exported in violation of export controls, we cannot guarantee that these precautions will prevent violations of export controls and similar regulations. In addition, our customers may be subject to export control laws, and any violations by our customers could harm our reputation and they could seek to hold us responsible for any monetary losses.

In addition, various countries regulate the import and export of certain encryption and other technology, including imposing import and export permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted and may enact laws that could limit our ability to distribute aspects of our platforms or could limit our customers’ ability to access our platforms in those countries. Any change in import or export regulations or related legislation, or change in the countries, 

23

governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our platforms and other workforce solutions by customers with international operations and adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We are vulnerable to intellectual property infringement claims and challenges to our intellectual property rights brought against us by third parties.

We operate in a highly competitive industry, and there has been considerable activity in our industry to develop and enforce intellectual property rights. Intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers or third-party partners could result in monetary liability or a material disruption to our business. We cannot be certain that aspects of our platforms and other workforce solutions, content, and brand names do not or will not infringe valid patents, trademarks, copyrights, or other intellectual property rights held by third parties, including our competitors. Also, we are in the ordinary course of our business subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property of others, including our competitors. The likelihood of intellectual property-related litigation and disputes may increase as platforms like ours gain more prominence. In addition, the improper use of AI by customers may lead to additional claims of intellectual property infringement. Our competitors and other third parties have in the past challenged, and may in the future challenge, our registration or use of our trademarks, including “Upwork,” and other intellectual property rights, and such a challenge, even if unsuccessful, could adversely affect our brands and business. We may also be obligated to indemnify certain clients or strategic partners or others in connection with such infringement claims, or to obtain licenses from third parties.

Any litigation or other disputes relating to allegations of intellectual property infringement could divert management attention and resources, subject us to significant legal costs and liability for damages or new licenses, invalidate our proprietary rights, or require us to alter our platforms, or marketing strategy or other aspects of our business.

Failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business.

Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology and data. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and contractual arrangements, to protect our proprietary rights and prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property, copying our platforms and other workforce solutions, and using information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours. Despite the precautions that we take, our intellectual property is vulnerable to unauthorized access through employee or third-party error or actions, theft, cybersecurity incidents, private or public economic espionage, and other security breaches and incidents.

We may not pursue or file patent applications or apply for registration of copyrights or trademarks in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we have an online presence with respect to our potentially patentable inventions, works of authorship, and marks and logos for a variety of reasons, including the cost or ability to procure such rights and the uncertainty involved in obtaining adequate protection. In addition, the applications for patents or for registration of copyrights or trademarks that we do pursue or file may not be successful and we may be required to change how we market any impacted offerings. Moreover, changes to intellectual property laws and regulations, including U.S. and foreign patent or trademark law, may affect our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights or defend against or offensively assert infringement claims.

The laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection for our intellectual property as the laws of the United States, and effective intellectual property protection may not be available to us in every country in which our platforms and other workforce solutions are available. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents or other intellectual property rights against certain third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. Further, certain countries impose additional conditions on the transfer of intellectual property rights from individuals to companies, which may make it more difficult for us to secure and maintain intellectual property protection. 

We also rely on trade secrets as an important aspect of our intellectual property program and to cover much of our technology and know-how. We seek to protect our trade secrets and obtain rights in intellectual property developed by service providers through confidentiality and invention assignment or intellectual property ownership agreements with our employees, contractors, and other parties, as well as through implementing acceptable use policies, limiting access to our information and data through technological means, and monitoring and limiting the dissemination of our information and data outside of company-owned information systems. These agreements and terms may not be enforceable or compliant with applicable law, and these agreements and other measures may not effectively protect our trade secrets and intellectual property rights. Most of our employees and all of the contractors with which we 

24

work are remote, which may make it more difficult to control use of confidential materials, increasing the risk that our source code or other confidential or trade secret information may be exposed. 

If we do not protect and enforce our intellectual property rights or our proprietary technology and data successfully or cost-effectively, our competitive position and brand may suffer, which would adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.

The use of open source software could restrict our ability to market or operate our platforms and could negatively affect our business.

Our platforms incorporate certain open source software. An open source license typically permits the use, modification, and distribution of software in source code form subject to certain conditions. These conditions may require that any person who distributes a modification or derivative work of open source software make the modified version subject to the same open source license. This could lead to a requirement that certain aspects of our platforms be distributed or made available in source code form. Although we do not believe that we have used open source software in such a manner, the interpretation of open source licenses is complex and, despite our efforts, it is possible that we may be liable for copyright infringement, breach of contract, or other claims if our use of open source software is found non-compliant with the applicable open source licenses.

Moreover, we cannot ensure that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our platforms will be effective. If we have not complied with the terms of an applicable open source software license, we may need to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering a platform and the terms on which such licenses are available may not be economically feasible, and may be required to re-engineer a platform to remove or replace the open source software, discontinue offering the platform, pay monetary damages, or make available the source code for aspects of our proprietary technology, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

In addition, the use of open source software can involve greater risks and require greater efforts to ensure legal and regulatory compliance compared to the use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or assurances of title, performance, or non-infringement, nor do they control the origin of the software. There is typically no support available for open source software and no assurance that updates will be made to address security risks. Many of the risks associated with the use of open source software cannot be eliminated and could negatively affect our business.

Litigation could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.

From time to time, we are involved in litigation and other legal proceedings and make and receive demands and claims threatening possible legal proceedings. The outcome of any litigation or other legal proceeding (including class actions and individual lawsuits or arbitration), regardless of its merits, is inherently uncertain. Regardless of the merits or ultimate outcome of any claims, pending or future legal proceedings could result in a diversion of management’s attention and resources and reputational harm and cause us to incur significant expenses and liabilities. We may determine that the most cost-effective and efficient way to resolve a dispute is via settlement, and terms of any settlement agreements are increasingly limited by legislation. Where we can make a reasonable estimate of the liability relating to a pending proceeding and determine that it is probable, we record a related liability. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability and revise estimates as appropriate. However, the amount of our estimates could be incorrect. In addition, while we maintain insurance with respect to many claims, certain claims may not be covered by our insurance, and there can be no assurance that our insurance will cover liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all.

In particular, Lifted’s Enterprise offerings include its subsidiaries employing talent on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces. Lifted and its subsidiaries’ ability to control the workplace environment is limited. As the employer of record of temporary employees, Lifted subsidiaries incur a risk of liability to their temporary employees for various workplace events, including claims of physical injury, discrimination, harassment, or failure to protect confidential personal information. In addition, the talent engaged through Lifted may access client workspaces from their personal devices through cloud-based systems. If cybersecurity incidents were to occur as a result, Lifted may face legal and contractual liability, reputational damage, loss of business, and other expenses. Lifted also incurs a risk of liability to clients resulting from allegations of damages caused by talent acting on phishing emails, cyberattacks, and other errors, omissions, or theft, or allegations of compromise of client confidential information. In some cases, Lifted or a Lifted subsidiary has agreed to indemnify clients in respect of these types of claims.

25

Any adverse determination related to a legal proceeding or adverse terms contained in a settlement agreement could require us to change our technology or our business practices in costly ways, prevent us from offering certain offerings or services, require us to pay monetary damages, fines, or penalties, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements, and could adversely affect our reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition.

If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, our results of operations could be harmed.

Under Sections 3(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, which we refer to as the Investment Company Act, absent an applicable exemption, a company generally will be deemed to be an “investment company” for purposes of the Investment Company Act if (i) it is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities or (ii) it is engaged, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities and it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We do not believe that we are an “investment company,” as such term is defined in either of these sections of the Investment Company Act, including as a result of both the exemption set forth in Section 3(b)(1) of the Investment Company Act and the safe harbor set forth in Rule 3a-8 of the Investment Company Act. Section 3(b)(1) of the Investment Company Act provides that a company that would otherwise fit within the definition of an “investment company” under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act will not be required to register as an “investment company” if “it is primarily engaged, directly or through a wholly owned subsidiary or subsidiaries, in a business or businesses other than that of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities.” We believe that we are and hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily in the operation of an online work marketplace, and our historical development, public representations of policy, the activity of our officers and directors, the nature of our present assets, the sources of our present income, and the public perception of the nature of our business all support the conclusion that we are an operating company and not an investment company. Rule 3a-8 under the Investment Company Act provides a nonexclusive safe harbor from the definition of “investment company” for certain research and development companies. We are currently a research and development company and comply with the safe harbor requirements of Rule 3a-8 under the Investment Company Act. As set forth above, we currently conduct, and intend to continue to conduct, our operations so that neither we, nor any of our subsidiaries, is required to register as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act. If we were obligated to register as an “investment company,” we would have to comply with a variety of substantive requirements under the Investment Company Act that impose, among other things, limitations on capital structure, restrictions on specified investments, prohibitions on transactions with affiliates, and compliance with reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy disclosure and other rules and regulations that would increase our operating and compliance costs, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Risks Related to Finance, Accounting, and Tax Matters

We have a history of net losses, may increase our operating expenses in the future, and may not be able to sustain profitability.

We have incurred net losses in the past, and as of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $78.5 million. While we were in a retained earnings position as of December 31, 2025, we have made, and expect to continue to make in the future, significant expenditures related to the development and expansion of our business, including the launch and ongoing development of Lifted. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently, or at all, to offset these higher expenses. While our GSV and revenue have grown in recent years, we may not be able to sustain the same level of growth in future periods, or at all. In addition, although our profitability has improved in recent periods, if our revenue declines or fails to grow at a rate faster than increases in our operating expenses, we will not be able to maintain profitability in future periods and the trading price of our common stock could decline. 

Our operating results and performance metrics may fluctuate from period to period, which makes our future results difficult to predict.

Our operating results and performance metrics have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future, particularly in periods of macroeconomic uncertainty, elevated interest rates and inflation. Our operating results and performance metrics in any given period can be influenced by numerous factors, many of which are unpredictable or are outside of our control, including those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section as well as the following: 

26

•uncertainty regarding macroeconomic and political conditions and demand for our business;

•our ability to maintain and grow our community of customers;

•our ability to respond to competitive developments and other market and technological dynamics, such as the emergence of AI, and introduce new offerings and services or enhance existing offerings;

•changes to our pricing model and fee structure, including any resulting changes to our revenue recognition practices;

•changes in the spending patterns of clients or the mix of products and services that clients demand;

•the impact of reductions in our workforce or involuntary or voluntary separations, including claims against us from departing employees or others;

•fluctuations in gross margin and revenue, including as a result of fluctuations in the use of our Enterprise business’s Managed Services offering due to our recognition of the entire GSV from the Managed Services offering as revenue, including the amounts paid to talent;

•the productivity, effectiveness, and efficiency of our sales force and the length and complexity of our sales cycles;

•the impact of changing, consolidating, or terminating offerings and services;

•losses from clients failing to pay invoices, particularly in instances where we advance payments to talent for invoiced services on behalf of the client;

•the disbursement methods chosen by talent and changes in the mix of disbursement methods offered;

•fluctuations in the prices that talent charge clients on the Upwork Marketplace;

•seasonality in the labor market and spending patterns by clients and the number of business days and the number of Sundays (i.e., the day we have the contractual right to bill and recognize revenue for the majority of our talent service fees each week) in any given period, as well as local, national, or international holidays;

•fluctuations in transaction losses;

•fluctuations in the mix of payment provider costs and the revenue generated from payment providers;

•changes to financial accounting standards and the interpretation of those standards that may affect the way we recognize and report our financial results; and

•fluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly if we are unable to fully offset the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates through derivative instruments designed to hedge against certain exposures to such fluctuations.

The impact of one or more of the foregoing and other factors may cause our operating results and performance metrics to vary significantly. As such, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results and performance metrics may not be meaningful and you should not rely upon past performance as an indicator of future performance.

The applicability of sales, use, and other tax laws or regulations on our business could subject us or our customers to additional tax liability and related interest and penalties, and adversely impact our business.

We are subject to numerous taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to evaluate applicable tax obligations and in many cases the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing statutes might apply to our business. As a result, we may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in federal, state, and international tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances; changes to our business operations; changes in taxing jurisdictions and administrative interpretations and applications; results of tax examinations, settlements, or judicial decisions; or changes in accounting principles. Moreover, a number of countries and intergovernmental organizations have recently proposed, recommended, or enacted new laws or changes to existing laws that could impact our tax and reporting obligations or add new compliance costs to our business to administer, assess, collect, and remit those taxes, and countries may propose or enact new laws that tax our or our customers’ activities in response to the imposition of new trade barriers. These changes may happen with little or no advance notice or implementation time, which can increase various short term 

27

costs of compliance. The impact and burden of these regulations and proposed regulations on our business and the businesses of our customers is uncertain and may have a negative impact on our business.

Any changes to our business operations, including international expansions, internal reorganizations, and transfer pricing could impact our tax liabilities. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for pricing intercompany transactions or disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions or specific affiliates. If such a challenge or disagreement were to occur, and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest, and penalties.

At any given time we may be subject to tax audits by various taxing authorities, in multiple jurisdictions, throughout the world. While we believe our income and other tax liabilities are reasonably estimated, an adverse result from one or more of these tax audits or investigations could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results. In addition, our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Such changes could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.

We track certain performance metrics with internal tools and do not independently verify such metrics. Certain of our performance metrics may not accurately reflect certain details of our business, are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.

We track certain performance metrics, including active clients and GSV per active client, GSV, and Marketplace take rate, with internal tools that are not independently verified by any third party. Our internal tools have a number of limitations and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in inaccurate or unexpected changes to our metrics. If the internal tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. Our performance metrics are also impacted by illegal or improper activity on the Upwork Marketplace, including fraud, spam, and fake accounts. We are unable to prevent all fraudulent activity from being reflected in the performance metrics that we report. Accordingly, our performance metrics may not accurately reflect activity on and the performance of our platforms and other workforce solutions. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data, or the accuracy of the data that we measure, may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our longer-term strategies and our ability to respond to business trends that may negatively impact our performance. If our performance metrics are not accurate representations of our business, customer base, or activity on our platforms and other workforce solutions; if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics; or if the metrics we rely on to track our performance do not provide an accurate measurement of our business, our reputation may be harmed, we may be subject to legal or regulatory actions, and our operating and financial results could be adversely affected.

If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable laws and regulations could be impaired.

Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud. We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, material weaknesses are identified, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our common stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market.

In addition, regulators are increasingly focusing on environmental, social, and governance matters and related disclosures. If our related data, processes, and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to achieve progress with our stated goals on a timely basis, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely impacted.

Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes is limited.

As of December 31, 2025, we had net operating loss, which we refer to as NOL, carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes and California state income tax purposes of $2.0 million and $90.9 million, respectively, available to offset future taxable income. The federal NOL carryforwards of $2.0 million generated after December 31, 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely with utilization in any year limited to 80% of our taxable income or any 

28

limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code. The California state NOL carryforward amounts will begin to expire in 2032 if not utilized. 

Realization of these NOL carryforwards depends on future income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. In addition, under Section 382 of the Code, a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income. As of December 31, 2025, we have experienced ownership changes that will result in limitations in our ability to use certain NOLs and tax credit carryforwards. In addition, other factors outside our control could further limit our ability to utilize NOLs to offset future U.S. federal and state taxable income, including further changes in the ownership of our stock and regulatory changes. Any such material limitation or expiration of our NOLs may harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations. 

We may require additional capital to fund our business and support our growth, and any inability to generate or obtain such capital may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

To support our growth and business strategy, such as developing new features or enhancements to our platforms and other workforce solutions and improving our infrastructure, we have made and expect to continue to make significant financial investments in our business. In addition, we may, from time to time, seek to acquire or strategically invest in other complementary products, technologies, or businesses or repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock or our 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2026, which we refer to as the Notes. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2025, we repurchased $100.0 million of our common stock under the $100.0 million share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in October 2024, which we refer to as the 2024 Share Repurchase Authorization, and $36.0 million of our common stock under the $100.0 million share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in September 2025, which we refer to as the 2025 Share Repurchase Authorization. We refer to the 2024 Share Repurchase Authorization and the 2025 Share Repurchase Authorization together as the Share Repurchase Authorizations. As of December 31, 2025, we had $64.0 million available for repurchases of our common stock under the 2025 Share Repurchase Authorization. We may need to engage in equity or debt financings to obtain the funds required for these investments, acquisitions, and other business endeavors. If we raise additional funds through equity or convertible debt issuances, our existing stockholders may suffer significant dilution and these securities could have rights, preferences, and privileges that are superior to those of holders of our common stock. If we obtain additional funds through debt financing, we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us. Such terms may involve additional restrictive covenants making it difficult to engage in capital raising activities and pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions and strategic investments. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing on terms satisfactory to us or at all, our ability to continue to support our business growth and business strategy could be significantly impaired and our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock

The stock price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.

The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, particularly in periods of broader stock market fluctuations and macroeconomic uncertainty. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are unpredictable or are outside of our control, including those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section as well as the following:

•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results and performance metrics, particularly any failure to meet the estimates of securities analysts or the expectations of investors;

•the financial projections we provide to the public or our lowering of or failure to meet these projections;

•the economy or equity markets as a whole and market conditions in our industry, including as a result of tariffs and trade wars;

•negative publicity related to the trustworthiness, quality, or security of our platforms and other workforce solutions;

•changes in our board of directors, management or key personnel;

29

•failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, inaccurate or unfavorable research by analysts, or changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company;

•repurchases by us of any of our outstanding shares of common stock or the Notes;

•speculative trading practices by stockholders and other market participants;

•rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry and/or other industries;

•legal and regulatory claims, litigation, or pre-litigation disputes and other proceedings;

•announcements by us or our competitors of significant new or terminated products or services, technical innovations, or acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;

•sales or expected sales of shares of our common stock by us, our officers, directors, employees or stockholders;

•changes in the legal or regulatory landscape applicable to us or our customers, including worker classification and tax laws; and

•geopolitical changes or events, including those resulting from war and incidents of terrorism. 

In addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business.

We cannot guarantee that the 2025 Share Repurchase Authorization will be fully consummated or that share repurchases will enhance long-term stockholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our common stock and diminish our cash reserves.

During the year ended December 31, 2025, we repurchased and subsequently retired 9.3 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate amount of $136.0 million under the Share Repurchase Authorizations, and we had $64.0 million available for repurchases under the 2025 Share Repurchase Authorization as of December 31, 2025. The actual timing and amount of any repurchases under the 2025 Share Repurchase Authorization will depend on a variety of factors, including stock price, trading volume, market and business conditions, regulatory requirements, and other considerations, all of which may be impacted by factors outside of our control. The 2025 Share Repurchase Authorization could affect the trading price of our common stock, increase volatility, and diminish our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities available to fund working capital, repayment of debt, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments, or business opportunities, and other general corporate purposes. The 2025 Share Repurchase Authorization may be suspended, terminated, or modified at any time for any reason, and we cannot guarantee that any share repurchase authorization will be fully consummated, or at all, or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.

Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, and significant stockholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate.

The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market, or the perception that such sales could occur, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, and significant stockholders. The perception that these sales might occur may also cause the market price of our common stock to decline. All shares of our common stock are freely tradable, generally without restrictions or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which we refer to as the Securities Act, subject to certain exceptions for shares held by our “affiliates” as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. In addition, the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or settlement of outstanding restricted stock units will be available for immediate resale in the United States on the open market. Moreover, we may also issue shares of common stock, securities convertible into shares of our common stock, or preferred stock with preferences over our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, an acquisition, investments, or otherwise. Any such issuances could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.

30

We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.

We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that for the foreseeable future we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business, for repurchases under our 2025 Share Repurchase Authorization, and for general corporate purposes. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.

Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees, and limit the market price of our common stock.

Provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:

•classify our board of directors into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms;

•permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships;

•require super-majority voting to amend certain provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws;

•authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a “poison pill”);

•provide that only the chairperson of our board of directors, our chief executive officer, president, lead independent director, or a majority of our board of directors are authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;

•prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;

•provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; and

•establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.

In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, which we refer to as the DGCL, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws, any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, or any action asserting an “internal corporate claim” as that term is defined in Section 115 of the DGCL. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the federal district courts of the United States would be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision. We note, however, that there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce this provision. These choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees.

Moreover, Section 203 of the DGCL may discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations, and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock.

Risks Related to Our Convertible Senior Notes

Our indebtedness could limit the cash flow available for our operations and expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

31

In August 2021, we issued the Notes. The Notes are senior, unsecured obligations and bear interest at a rate of 0.25% per year. The Notes will mature on August 15, 2026, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased, or converted in accordance with the terms of the Notes. In March 2023, we repurchased a portion of the outstanding Notes, and, as of December 31, 2025, $361.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes remained outstanding. We may also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. Our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our stockholders and our business, operating results, and financial condition by, among other things:

•increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;

•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing;

•requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes;

•limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business;

•diluting the interests of our existing stockholders as a result of issuing shares of our common stock upon conversion of the Notes; and

•placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with competitors that are less leveraged than us or have better access to capital.

Our business may not generate sufficient funds, and we may otherwise be unable to maintain sufficient cash reserves, to pay amounts due under our indebtedness, and our cash needs may increase in the future.

The capped call transactions may affect the value of our common stock.

In connection with the Notes, we entered into the privately negotiated Capped Calls with various financial institutions, which we refer to as the option counterparties. The Capped Calls remain in effect notwithstanding the March 2023 repurchase of a portion of the Notes. The Capped Calls are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the Notes and/or offset any potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of any Notes, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap.

In addition, the option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock in secondary market transactions (and are likely to do so following any conversion of Notes, any repurchase of the Notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date, any redemption date, or any other date on which the Notes are retired by us). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock.

The potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock.

General Risks

Adverse or changing economic conditions may negatively impact our business.

Our business depends on the overall demand for labor and on the economic health of current and prospective clients. Any significant weakening of the economy in the United States or Europe or of the global economy, including a continued rise in inflation, higher tariffs, trade wars, hiring freezes, layoffs, more limited availability of credit, a reduction in business confidence and activity, decreased government or business spending, government shutdowns, economic and political uncertainty, financial turmoil or instability affecting the banking system or financial markets, sanctions, global or regional public health events or conditions, a more limited market for contingent service providers or information technology services, shifts away from remote work, and other adverse economic or market conditions may adversely impact our business and operating results. These adverse conditions have resulted, and may again result, in reductions in revenue, increased operating expenses, longer sales cycles, and increased competition. There is also a risk that when overall global economic conditions are positive, our business could be negatively impacted by a decreased demand for talent as businesses utilize more direct, full-time employees relative to their use of contingent workers. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown, or any subsequent recovery generally. If the conditions in the general economy deteriorate, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Item 1C. Cybersecurity.

Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy

Our cybersecurity and data privacy risk management processes are integrated into our enterprise risk management program, and we have established processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks arising from cybersecurity threats. We maintain physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to protect information assets and have defined procedures for incident detection, containment, response, and remediation. Our information security team is primarily responsible for managing cybersecurity risk and works in close coordination with our legal team on data privacy risk management. We conduct regular cybersecurity test exercises involving relevant stakeholders to reinforce roles, decision-making processes, and escalation protocols. These exercises are designed not only to confirm accountability, but also to strengthen organizational readiness by training teams to respond effectively under realistic conditions and to continuously improve our incident response capabilities. We have implemented controls and procedures to support the timely identification and escalation of cybersecurity incidents, enabling management to evaluate, respond to, and determine appropriate disclosure and reporting actions in a timely manner.

Our platforms and workforce solutions maintain security and privacy programs informed by industry-recognized standards and frameworks, including ISO standards and SOC reporting, as appropriate for their respective products, operating environments, and customer requirements. These programs are designed to support the protection of customer data and compliance with applicable security and privacy obligations. Certain platforms and workforce solutions maintain separate certifications and attestations that reflect their distinct environments and enterprise customer needs.

Our information security controls operate at multiple levels and are designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate cybersecurity threats that could affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data and our customers’ data. To support operations at scale, we have automated certain risk mitigation measures and regularly evaluate their effectiveness. We have implemented trust and safety processes intended to help prevent and detect suspicious and fraudulent activity on our platforms. As part of the development and operation of the Upwork Marketplace, we have designed and refined proprietary detection mechanisms, including pattern-based techniques, to identify anomalous or potentially malicious behavior, and we continue to enhance these capabilities in response to an evolving threat landscape. We regularly review and update our information security policies, standards, and procedures to reflect changes in our cybersecurity posture, emerging risks, and risk mitigation strategies. We also provide regular, mandatory cybersecurity training to our personnel to raise awareness of cybersecurity risks, reinforce secure practices, and communicate updates to our information security policies, standards, processes, and practices.

We engage third parties, including vendors and other external service providers, to support elements of our cybersecurity and data privacy programs, such as risk assessments, program enhancements, and user verification services. These third parties provide security-related services, including independent evaluations of our security environment and assessments of our technology and security controls using industry-recognized frameworks. We also operate a vulnerability disclosure and bug bounty program to support the ongoing identification of potential security vulnerabilities. In addition, our information security team performs regular security scans to identify known vulnerabilities and supports remediation efforts as appropriate. 

We maintain processes to identify, assess, and oversee cybersecurity risks associated with our use of third-party service providers. Our approach is risk-based and is designed to evaluate cybersecurity risks posed by vendors, service providers, and other third parties, including risks arising from third-party systems that could adversely affect our business in the event of a cybersecurity incident. As part of these processes, we perform due diligence on vendors and prospective vendors with respect to their cybersecurity practices and controls. Cybersecurity risk management is integrated into our broader enterprise risk management program, which is overseen by the audit, risk and compliance committee of our board of directors, which we refer to as our audit committee, and cybersecurity considerations are an important component of our overall approach to enterprise risk management.

We deploy technical safeguards designed to protect our information systems from cybersecurity threats, including network security controls, intrusion detection and prevention technologies, endpoint detection and response capabilities, logging, monitoring and alerting mechanisms, anti-malware protections, advanced email security, and access controls. These safeguards are evaluated and enhanced through vulnerability assessments and the use of 

33

cybersecurity threat intelligence. Access to our platform is encrypted using industry-standard transport layer security protocols. Sensitive information transmitted through our platform, including certain personal and financial data, is encrypted during transmission, and data stored on systems containing personally identifiable information is encrypted at rest. We also implement additional security mechanisms, such as HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), to help ensure secure connections to our website. Customers may elect to enhance the security of their accounts by enabling multi-factor authentication. In addition, we maintain compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) for payment processing, reflecting adherence to industry-recognized security requirements applicable to organizations that process payment card transactions.

To date, cybersecurity threats, including any prior cybersecurity incidents, have not had a material impact on our business strategy, operating results, or financial condition. However, a future material cybersecurity incident could have a material adverse effect on our business strategy, operating results, or financial condition. For more information regarding cybersecurity risks that we face and potential impacts on our business related thereto, see “Risk Factors—If we or our third-party partners experience a security breach, other hacking or phishing attack, ransomware or other malware attack, or other privacy or security incident, our platforms and other workforce solutions may be perceived as not being secure, our reputation may be harmed, demand for our offerings may be reduced, our operations may be disrupted, we may incur significant legal costs, fines, or liabilities, and our business could be adversely affected.”

Cybersecurity Governance

While everyone at Upwork plays a part in managing cybersecurity and data privacy risks, oversight responsibility is shared by our board of directors, audit committee, and management.

Our board of directors, as a whole, has responsibility for risk oversight, and the committees of our board of directors oversee and review risk areas that are particularly relevant to their respective functions. Among its focus areas, our audit committee reviews matters relating to cybersecurity and data privacy and regularly reports to our board of directors regarding such matters. One member of our audit committee earned NACD’s CERT Certificate in Cybersecurity Oversight in 2025. Our Chief Information Security Officer, who we refer to as our CISO, presents quarterly cybersecurity-related updates to our audit committee, including at least one update to the full board of directors each year, regarding recent developments, evolving standards, metrics about cyber threat response preparedness, program maturity milestones, material cybersecurity risks and risk mitigation status, and the current and emerging threat landscape. We also have implemented controls and procedures that provide for the communication of material cybersecurity incidents to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and Chief Legal Officer, as well as to our audit committee and/or to our full board of directors on a timely basis.

Our CISO leads our cybersecurity risk management program and collaborates closely with our legal team on data privacy matters at the management level. Appointed as our CISO in April 2025 after joining Upwork in 2021, our CISO has over two decades of experience in technology leadership roles across the healthcare and technology industries, including dedicated information security leadership positions at two publicly traded companies (including Upwork) since 2016. Our CISO is supported by a seasoned leadership team composed of information security professionals who have held roles at some of the most well-known global brands and are recognized experts in their respective fields. Our CISO actively oversees and participates in the development and implementation of our cybersecurity policies and procedures, and the cybersecurity team provides the CISO with regular updates on the threat landscape, incidents, and emerging risks. Our CISO and his team provide regular updates to the management team and promptly escalate issues that warrant executive attention.
