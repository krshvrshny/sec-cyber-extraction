Risks Related to Our Business

Adverse global economic conditions could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and liquidity.

A general slowdown in the global economy or in a particular region or industry, other unfavorable changes in economic conditions, such as inflation, higher interest rates, tightening of the credit markets, recession or slowing growth, or an increase in trade tensions with U.S. trading partners could negatively impact our business, financial condition and liquidity. Adverse global economic conditions have from time to time caused or exacerbated significant slowdowns in the industries and markets in which we operate, which have adversely affected our business and results of operations. Macroeconomic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast operating results, and may make it more difficult to raise or refinance debt. An escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China has resulted in trade restrictions, increased protectionism and increased tariffs that harm our ability to participate in Chinese markets or compete effectively with Chinese companies. Sustained uncertainty about, or worsening of, current global economic conditions and further escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners, especially China, and the decoupling of the U.S. and China economies, could result in a global economic slowdown and long-term changes to global trade. Such events may also (i) cause our customers and consumers to reduce, delay or forgo technology spending, (ii) result in customers sourcing products from other suppliers not subject to such restrictions or tariffs, (iii) lead to the insolvency or consolidation of key suppliers and customers, and (iv) intensify pricing pressures. Any or all of these factors could negatively affect demand for our products and our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our business is subject to various governmental regulations. Compliance with these regulations may cause us to incur significant expense and failure to maintain compliance with applicable regulations could adversely affect our business.

Our business is subject to various domestic and international laws and other legal requirements, including anti-competition and import/export regulations, such as the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, and applicable executive 

17


orders. These laws, regulations and orders are complex, may change frequently and with limited notice, and generally become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with, or to remedy violations of, these regulations. In addition, if our customers fail to comply with these regulations, we may be required to suspend sales to these customers, which could damage our reputation and negatively impact our results of operations. The U.S. government may continue to add companies to its restricted entity list and/or technologies to its list of prohibited exports to specific countries, which have had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our revenue and our ability to sell our products. These restrictive governmental actions and any similar measures that may be imposed on U.S. companies by other governments, especially in light of ongoing trade tensions with China, will likely limit or prevent us from doing business with certain of our customers or suppliers and harm our ability to compete effectively or otherwise negatively affect our ability to sell our products. Furthermore, government authorities may take retaliatory actions, impose conditions for the supply of products or require the license or other transfer of IP, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our products and operations are also subject to regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory agencies, such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. We have previously been, and may in the future be, involved or required to participate in regulatory investigations or inquiries, such as the ongoing investigation by the Korean Fair Trade Commission into certain of our contracting and business practices, which have previously and may in the future evolve into legal or other administrative proceedings. Growing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporations is leading to increased anti-competition legislation, regulation, administrative rule making and enforcement activity. Involvement in regulatory investigations or inquiries can be costly, lengthy, complex and time consuming, diverting the attention and energies of our management and technical personnel. If any pending or future governmental investigations result in an unfavorable resolution, we could be required to cease the manufacture and sale of the subject products or technology, pay fines or disgorge profits or other payments, and/or cease certain conduct and/or modify our contracting or business practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Global political and economic conditions and other factors related to our international operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

A majority of our products are produced, sourced and sold internationally and our international revenue represents a significant percentage of our overall revenue. Multiple factors relating to our international operations and to particular countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These factors include:

•changes in political, regulatory, legal or economic conditions, geopolitical turmoil (including China-Taiwan relations), including terrorism, war or political or military coups, state-sponsored or politically motivated cyber-attacks, or civil disturbances or political instability (foreign and domestic);

•restrictive governmental actions, such as restrictions on the transfer or repatriation of funds and foreign investments, data privacy regulations, climate change regulations and trade protection measures, including increasing protectionism, import/export restrictions (including with regards to advanced technologies), import/export duties and quotas, trade sanctions and customs duties and tariffs, all of which have increased and may further increase;

•changes in global tax regulations;

•difficulty in obtaining product distribution and support, and transportation delays;

•potential inability to localize software products;

•difficulty in enforcing contracts, collecting accounts receivables and maintaining appropriate financial controls;

•difficulty in conducting due diligence with respect to business partners;

•public health or safety concerns, medical epidemics or pandemics, and other natural- or man-made disasters; and

•nationalization of businesses and expropriation of assets.

A significant legal risk associated with conducting business internationally is compliance with the various and differing laws and regulations of the many countries in which we do business. Although our policies prohibit us, our employees and our agents from engaging in unethical business practices, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, distributors or other agents will refrain from acting in violation of our related anti-corruption or other policies and procedures. Any such violation could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Failure to realize the benefits expected from the VMware Merger could adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock.

As part of our integration of the VMware business, we are focusing on VMware’s core business of creating private cloud environments on-premises among large enterprises globally and divesting non-core assets. If VMware customers do not accept our business strategy, including our transition from a perpetual to a subscription licensing model and our simplified product portfolio, the investments we have made or may make to implement our strategy may be of no or limited value, we may lose significant customers, our financial results may be adversely affected and our stock price may suffer.

Although we expect significant benefits to result from the VMware Merger, if we do not successfully manage the challenges inherent in integrating an acquired business, we may not realize these benefits, and our revenue, expenses, operating results, financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected. Achieving these benefits will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate VMware's business successfully and efficiently and VMware customers accepting our business strategy, including our transition from a perpetual to a subscription licensing model and our simplified product portfolio. The successful integration of the VMware business has required, and will continue to require, significant management attention, and may divert the attention of management from other business and operational issues.

We have pursued, and may in the future pursue, mergers, acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and dispositions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.

Our growth strategy includes acquiring or investing in businesses that offer complementary products, services and technologies, or enhancing our market coverage or technological capabilities. Any acquisitions we may undertake, including the VMware Merger, and their integration involve risks and uncertainties, which could impede the execution of our business strategy, such as:

•U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory approval may take longer than anticipated, not be forthcoming or contain burdensome conditions;

•unexpected delays, challenges and related expenses, and disruption of our business;

•diversion of management’s attention from daily operations and the pursuit of other opportunities;

•incurring significant restructuring charges and amortization expense, assuming liabilities and ongoing or new lawsuits, potential impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, and increasing our expenses and working capital requirements; 

•the potential for deficiencies in internal controls of the acquired business, as well as implementing our own management information systems, operating systems and internal controls for the acquired operations;

•our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with the acquired business’ products, financial disclosures, accounting practices, legal, tax and other contingencies, compliance with local laws and regulations (and interpretations thereof) in the U.S. and multiple international jurisdictions;

•difficulties integrating the acquired business or company and in managing and retaining acquired employees, vendors and customers; and 

•inaccuracies in our original estimates and assumptions used to assess a transaction, which may result in us not realizing the expected financial or strategic benefits of any such transaction. 

From time to time, we seek to divest or wind down portions of our business or exit minority investments, any of which could materially affect our cash flows and results of operations. Such dispositions involve risks and uncertainties, including disruption to other parts of our business, potential loss of employees or customers, or exposure to unanticipated liabilities or ongoing obligations following any such dispositions. In addition, dispositions may include the transfer of technology and/or the licensing of certain IP rights to third-party purchasers that limits our ability to utilize such IP rights or assert these rights against third parties. Such events could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations.

We are subject to risks associated with our distributors and other channel partners, including product inventory levels and product sell-through.

We sell our products through a direct sales force and a select network of distributors and other channel partners globally. Sales to distributors accounted for 48% of our net revenue in fiscal year 2024 and are subject to a number of risks, including:

•fluctuations in demand based on our distributors’ product inventory levels, and the timing of delivery to and demand of end customers;

•our distributors and other channel partners are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customers and may market and distribute competing products; and

19


•our distributors’ and other channel partners’ agreements are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause.

Our dependence on channel partners has increased following the VMware Merger. Failure to maintain good relationships with our distributors and channel partners could adversely impact our business. In addition, we sell our semiconductor products through an increasingly limited number of distributors, which exposes us to additional customer concentration and related credit risks. 

From time to time, we enlist our distributors and channel partners to lead go-to-market and customer relationships for certain products, such as our Accelerate Program and Catalyst Initiative for certain infrastructure software products, with certain sole distribution relationships by region. To the extent these distributors and channel partners fail to maintain good relationships with our customers or we are unable to continue enlisting our distributors and channel partners to lead go-to-market and customer relationships, our business, operating results and cash flow may be adversely impacted.

We do not always have a direct relationship with the end customers of our products. As a result, our semiconductor products may be used in applications for which they were not necessarily designed or tested, and the misuse or failure of our semiconductor products could result in significant liabilities to us, damage our reputation and harm our business, operating results and cash flow.

Our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team.

Our success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our senior management team, in particular the services of Hock E. Tan, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Effective succession planning is also important for our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfers of knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management could hinder our strategic planning and execution. None of our senior management is bound by written employment contracts. In addition, we do not currently maintain key person life insurance covering our senior management. The loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate.

If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, especially our engineering and technical personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively.

Our future success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. As the source of our technological and product innovations, our engineering and technical personnel, such as our AI-related product engineers and cybersecurity experts, are a significant asset. Competition for these employees is significant in many areas of the world in which we operate, particularly in Silicon Valley and Southeast Asia where qualified engineers are in high demand. In addition, current or future immigration laws may make it more difficult to hire or retain qualified engineers, further limiting the pool of available talent. We believe equity awards provide a powerful long-term retention incentive and have historically granted these awards to the substantial majority of our employees. If we are unable to continue our current equity granting philosophy or our stock underperforms, this could impair our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel. Any inability to retain, attract or motivate such personnel and provide competitive employment benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Cyber security threats or other security breaches, or any other impairment of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our IT systems, or those of one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendors, could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our business depends on a wide variety of complex IT systems and services, including cloud-based and other critical corporate services relating to, among other things, product research and development, financial reporting, product orders and fulfillment, HR, benefit plan administration, IT network management, and electronic communication and collaboration services. These systems and services are both internally managed and outsourced, and in many cases we rely upon third-party data centers. Any failure of these internal or third-party systems and services to operate effectively could disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our IT infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect. Although these systems are designed to protect and secure our customers’, suppliers’ and employees’ confidential information, as well as our own proprietary information, we are, out of necessity, dependent on our vendors to adequately address cybersecurity threats to their own systems. In addition, software products we use and technologies produced by us have occasionally had in the past and may have in the future, vulnerabilities that, if left unmitigated, could reduce the overall level of security of the systems on which the software is installed. 

Cyber-attacks are increasing in number and sophistication, are well-financed, in some cases supported by state actors, and are designed to not only attack, but also to evade detection. Since the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems, or to otherwise sabotage them, change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target, we 

20


may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. The emergence and maturation of AI capabilities may also lead to new and/or more sophisticated methods of attack, including fraud that relies upon “deep fake” impersonation technology or other forms of generative automation that may scale up the efficiency or effectiveness of cyber threat activity.

As a critical vendor in the digital supply chain for both governmental entities and critical infrastructure operators, we and our products may be targeted by those seeking to threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of systems supporting essential public services. Geopolitical instability may increase the likelihood that we will experience direct or collateral consequences from cyber conflicts between nation-states or other politically motivated actors targeting critical technology infrastructure. 

Accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access to our information systems or the systems of our service providers and business partners, or the existence of computer viruses or malware (such as ransomware) in our or their data or software have in the past exposed, and could in the future expose, us to a risk of information loss, business disruption, and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information, including information relating to our products or customers and the personal information of our employees or third parties. Such an event could disrupt our business and result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, damage to our reputation, loss of our trade secrets and other competitive information, litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for liabilities and damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, significant remediation costs, disruption of key business operations and significant diversion of our resources, as well as fines and other sanctions resulting from any regulatory non-compliance, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, profitability and financial condition. While we may be entitled to damages if our vendors fail to perform under their agreements with us, any award may be insufficient to cover the actual costs incurred by us and, as a result of a vendor’s failure to perform, we may be unable to collect any damages.

Despite our internal controls and investment in security measures, we have, from time to time, been subject to disruptive cyber-attacks and unauthorized network intrusions and malware on our own IT networks or those of our service providers or business partners. Although no such cybersecurity incidents have been material to us, we continue to devote resources to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse, and we may be required to expend greater resources in the future. Businesses we acquire have previously increased, and may continue to increase, the scope and complexity of our IT networks, and this has, from time to time, increased our risk exposure to cyber-attacks when there are difficulties integrating diverse legacy systems that support operations for the acquired businesses.

In addition, certain aspects of effective cybersecurity are dependent upon our employees, contractors and other trusted partners reliably safeguarding secrets (e.g., application credentials) and adhering to our security policies and access control mechanisms. We have in the past experienced, and expect in the future to experience, security incidents arising from a failure to properly handle such secrets or adhere to such policies and, although no such events have had a material adverse effect on our business, there can be no assurance that an insider threat will not result in a material cyber incident. Our logging, alerting and cyber incident detection mechanisms may not cover every system potentially targeted by threat actors, may not have the capability to detect certain types of unauthorized activities, and may not capture and surface information sufficient to enable us to timely detect and take responsive action to insider or external threats.

U.S. and non-U.S. regulators, as well as customers and service providers, have also increased their focus on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Compliance with laws, regulations, and contractual provisions concerning privacy, cybersecurity, secure technology development, data governance, data protection, confidentiality and IP could result in significant expense, and any failure to comply could result in proceedings against us by regulatory authorities or other third parties and may also increase our overall compliance burden. See also “Failure of our software products to manage and security IT infrastructures and environments could have a material adverse effect on our business.”

The majority of our sales have historically come from a small number of customers and a reduction in demand or loss of one or more of our significant customers may adversely affect our business.

We have historically depended on a small number of end customers, OEMs, their respective contract manufacturers (“CMs”) and certain distributors for a majority of our business and revenue. For fiscal year 2024, sales to distributors accounted for 48% of our net revenue. We believe aggregate sales, through all channels, to our top five end customers accounted for approximately 40% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2024. This customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and our sensitivity to any material adverse developments experienced by these customers.

21


Our semiconductor customers are not generally required to purchase specific quantities of products. Even when customers agree to source an agreed portion of their product needs from us, such arrangements often include pricing schedules or methodologies that apply regardless of the volume of products purchased, and those customers may not purchase the amount of product we expect. As a result, we may not generate the amount of revenue or achieve the level of profitability we expect under such arrangements. Moreover, our top customers’ purchasing power has, in some cases, given them the ability to make greater demands on us with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general. Some customers may even reduce the amount of products or decline to purchase due to their internal development of the products. The loss of, or any substantial reduction in sales to, any of our top customers, including our hyperscale customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry.

The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by rapid price erosion, wide fluctuations in product supply and demand, constant and rapid technological change, evolving technical standards, evolving markets such as AI, frequent new product introductions, and short product life cycles. From time to time, these factors, together with changes in general economic conditions, cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry and in our business. The market for AI-related products has resulted in a significant upturn in certain segments of the industry resulting in record revenue, which may not be sustainable. Previously the industry experienced a significant upturn due to a supply imbalance that resulted in record profitability and increases in average selling prices, which was followed by a down-cycle resulting in diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels and periods of inventory adjustment, and elimination of expedite fees. Historically, such down-cycles have also been characterized by under-utilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix and accelerated erosion of average selling prices, which can lead to reduced profitability and a decline in our stock price. The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America Act could also result in an increase in supply leading to excess inventory and a decrease in average selling prices. We expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturns even when overall economic conditions are relatively stable. If we cannot offset industry or market downturns, our net revenue may decline and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer.

We make investments in research and development and the slow or unsuccessful return of our investments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, new technological trends such as AI and cloud computing, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, short product cycles, evolving industry standards and new delivery methods. In addition, to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry, we must continue to develop and respond to technological advancements and requirements, such as low-power consumption, higher bandwidth and increase in the number of clusters. Failure to successfully develop increasingly advanced technologies, including ASICs such as custom AI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products, could impair our competitive position. In order to remain competitive, we have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments in research and development. If we fail to timely develop new and enhanced products and technologies, if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, or if new competitive technologies that we do not support become widely accepted, demand for our products such as our custom AI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products may be reduced. Increased investments in research and development, or slow or unsuccessful research and development efforts, would have a negative impact on our financial results.

Winning business in the semiconductor solutions industry is subject to a lengthy process that often requires us to incur significant expense, from which we may ultimately generate no revenue.

Our semiconductor business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes, known as “design wins.” These selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate significant development expenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This can result in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future selection processes.

Winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer. Customers could delay or cancel plans, fail to qualify our products, reduce or discontinue use of our products or fail to successfully market and sell their products, which could reduce demand for our products and cause us to hold excess inventory, materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the timing of design wins is unpredictable and implementing production for a major design win or multiple design wins at the same time, such as our design wins for our custom AI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products, may strain our resources and those of our CMs. In such event, we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources such as product engineering and incur additional costs and expenses, which we expect to continue for our AI-related products. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our products, such as our AI-related products, are dependent on our continued success in the development and quality of our products and product engineering.

22


Dependence on contract manufacturing and suppliers of critical components within our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market, damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations.

We operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that principally utilizes CMs, such as third-party wafer foundries. Our semiconductor products require wafer manufacturers with state-of-the-art fabrication equipment and techniques, and most of our products are designed to be manufactured in a specific process, typically at one particular fab or foundry, either our own or with a particular CM. Qualifying and establishing reliable production at acceptable yields with a new CM, if at all, is a lengthy and often expensive process.

We depend on our CMs to allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality at acceptable yields, and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis. We do not generally have long-term capacity commitments with our CMs and substantially all of our manufacturing services are on a purchase order basis with no minimum quantities. Further, our CMs may fail to timely develop or successfully implement new, advanced manufacturing processes, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies. From time to time, our CMs may also cease to, or become unable to, manufacture a component for us. 

TSMC, one of our CMs, manufactured approximately 95% of the wafers manufactured by our CMs during fiscal year 2024. We believe our wafer requirements represent a meaningful portion of TSMC’s total production capacity. However, TSMC also fabricates wafers for other companies, including some of our competitors, and could choose or be required to prioritize capacity for other customers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice. In addition, TSMC has, and may in the future, raise their prices to us.  

If any of the foregoing circumstances occur, we may be unable to meet our customer demand, or to the same extent as our competitors, fail to meet our contractual obligations or forgo revenue opportunities. This could damage our relationships with our customers, result in litigation for alleged failure to meet our obligations, or result in payment of significant damages, and our net revenue could decline, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations and gross margin. 

We purchase a significant amount of the materials, including components, used in our products from a limited number of suppliers.

Our manufacturing processes and those of our CMs rely on many materials, including silicon, GaAs and InP wafers, copper lead frames, precious and rare earth metals, mold compound, ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases. During fiscal year 2024, we purchased approximately two-thirds of our manufacturing materials from five materials suppliers, some of which are single source suppliers. The lead time needed to identify and qualify a new supplier is typically lengthy and there is often no readily available alternative source. We do not generally have long-term contracts with our materials suppliers and substantially all of our purchases are on a purchase order basis. Suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies, place products on allocation or increase prices, any of which could disrupt supply or increase demand in the industry. Additionally, the supply of these materials may be negatively impacted by increased trade tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners, particularly China. Any such supply constraints could result in loss of revenue opportunities and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

A prolonged disruption of our or our suppliers’ manufacturing facilities, research and development facilities, warehouses or other significant operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Although we operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model, we also rely on our own manufacturing facilities, in particular in Fort Collins, Colorado, Singapore, and Breinigsville, Pennsylvania. Our Fort Collins and Breinigsville facilities are the sole sources for the FBAR components used in many of our wireless devices and for the InP-based wafers used in our fibre optics products, respectively. Many of our facilities, and those of our CMs and suppliers, are concentrated in the same geographic regions of California and the Pacific Rim, which have above average seismic activity and severe weather activity, and increases the risk of natural disasters impacting multiple suppliers. In addition, a significant majority of our research and development personnel are located in the Czech Republic, India, Israel, and the U.S., and our primary warehouse is in Malaysia.

A prolonged disruption at or shut-down of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or warehouses or those of our CMs or suppliers, due to natural- or man-made disasters or other events outside of our control, such as climate change, water shortages, political unrest, military conflicts, geopolitical turmoil, trade tensions, government orders, labor shortages, medical epidemics, economic instability, equipment failure or for any other reason, would limit our capacity to meet customer demands and delay new product development until a replacement facility and equipment, if necessary, were found. To date, such events have not had a material adverse effect on our business. However, such an event could disrupt our operations, forgo revenue opportunities, potentially lose market share, result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand, expose us to claims by our customers, result in significant expense to repair or replace our affected facilities, and, in some 

23


instances, could significantly curtail our research and development efforts in a particular product area or target market, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business. This disruption could also prevent our customers from resuming their own manufacturing following such an event, they may cancel or scale back their orders from us and this may in turn adversely affect our results of operations. Such events could also result in increased fixed costs relative to the revenue we generate and adversely affect our results of operations.

Failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations.

We make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing, internal fabrication utilization and other resource requirements, based on customer requirements or estimates thereof, which may not be accurate. Many factors could impact our estimates of customers’ demands, including changes in product development cycles, competing technologies and product releases, new or unexpected end-user products, such as demand for AI-related products, and changes in business and economic conditions. If we are unable to timely respond to changes in customer demand, this could damage our customer relationships, harm our reputation, prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may be unable to maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity or product yields at our own manufacturing facilities, which could adversely affect our relationships with our customers, and our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We must maintain appropriate capacity and product yields at our own manufacturing facilities to meet anticipated customer demand. From time to time, this requires us to invest in expansion or improvements of those facilities, which may not be sufficient or in time, to meet customer demand and we may have to put customers on product allocation, forgo sales or lose customers as a result. Conversely, if we overestimate customer demand, we would experience excess capacity and fixed costs at these facilities will not be fully absorbed, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Similarly, reduced product yields, due to design or manufacturing issues or otherwise, may involve significant time and cost to remedy and cause delays in our ability to supply product to our customers, all of which could cause us to forgo sales, incur liabilities or lose customers, and harm our results of operations.

We may be involved in legal proceedings, including IP, securities litigation, and employee-related claims, which could, among other things, divert efforts of management and result in significant expense and loss of our IP rights.

We are often involved in legal proceedings, including cases involving our IP rights and those of others, commercial matters, acquisition-related lawsuits, securities class action lawsuits, employee-related claims and other actions. Litigation or settlement of such actions, regardless of their merit, have been, and can continue to be, costly, lengthy, complex and time consuming, diverting the attention and energies of our management and technical personnel.

The industries in which we operate are characterized by companies holding large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and vigorously pursuing, protecting and enforcing IP rights, including actions by patent-holding companies that do not make or sell products. From time to time, third parties assert against us and our customers and distributors their IP rights to technologies that are important to our business. We may be required to indemnify our customers or purchasers for third-party IP infringement claims, including costs to defend those claims, and payment of damages in the case of adverse rulings. However, our CMs and suppliers may or may not be required to indemnify us should we or our customers be subject to such third-party claims. Claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. If any pending or future proceedings result in an adverse outcome, we could be required to:

•cease the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products, processes or technology and/or make changes to our processes or products;

•pay substantial damages for past, present and future use of the infringing technology, including up to treble damages if willful infringement is found;

•expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology;

•license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all;

•enter into cross-licenses with our competitors, which could weaken our overall IP portfolio and our ability to compete in particular product categories;

•pay substantial damages to our direct or end customers to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with non-infringing technology; or

24


•relinquish IP rights associated with one or more of our patent claims.

Any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Failure of our software products to manage and secure IT infrastructures and environments could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Certain aspects of our software products are intended to manage and secure IT infrastructures and environments, and as a result, we expect these products to be ongoing targets of cyber-attacks. Open source code or other third-party software used in these products could also be targeted and may make our products vulnerable to additional security risks not posed by purely proprietary products. Our products are complex and, when deployed, may contain errors, defects or security vulnerabilities, some of which may not be discovered before the product has been released, installed and used by customers. The complexity and breadth of our technical and production environments, which involve globally dispersed development and engineering teams, increases the risk that errors, defects or vulnerabilities will be introduced and may delay our ability to detect, mitigate or remediate such incidents.

In the past, elements of our proprietary source code have been exposed in an unauthorized manner. It is possible that such exposure of source code could reveal unknown security vulnerabilities in our products that could be exploited by malicious actors. Our products are also subject to known and unknown security vulnerabilities resulting from integration with third-party products or services.

Although we continually seek to improve our countermeasures to prevent such incidents, we may be unable to anticipate every scenario and it is possible that certain cyber threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack or an accidental incident on us and our customers. Additionally, efforts by malicious cyber actors or others could cause interruptions, delays or cessation of our product licensing, or modification of our software, which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers.

A successful cyber-attack involving our products could cause customers and potential customers to believe our services are ineffective or unreliable and result in, among other things, the loss of customers, unfavorable publicity, damage to our reputation, difficulty in marketing our products, and allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations, and give rise to significant costs, including costs related to developing solutions or indemnification obligations under our agreements. Any such event could adversely impact our revenue and results of operations. See also “Cyber security threats or other security breaches, or any other impairment of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our IT systems, or those of one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendors, could have a material adverse effect on our business.”

The growth of our software business depends on demand for our data center virtualization products, as well as customer acceptance of our products, services and business strategy.

Many of our software products and services are based on data center virtualization and related hybrid-cloud technologies used to manage distributed computing architectures, which form the foundation for hybrid-cloud computing. Enabling businesses to modernize applications and efficiently implement their hybrid-cloud services presents new and difficult technological, operational and compliance challenges. If businesses build new or shift existing compute workloads off-premises to public cloud providers, this could limit the market for on-premises deployments of our data center virtualization products. Current and future customers may not perceive benefits associated with adopting our hybrid-cloud and enterprise-grade private cloud platform or our simplified product portfolios. If demand is significantly less than anticipated or we fail to realize the expected returns on our business strategy, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.

If our software products do not remain compatible with ever-changing operating environments, platforms, or third-party products, demand for our products and services could decrease, which could materially adversely affect our business.

We may be required to make substantial modification of our products to maintain compatibility with operating systems, systems software and computer hardware used by our customers or to provide our customers with desired features or capabilities. We must also continually address the challenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends and competitive developments, such as the emergence of advanced persistent threats in the security space, to compete effectively. There can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt our products in response to these developments.

Further, our software solutions interact with a variety of software and hardware developed by third parties, as well as cloud providers. If we lose access to third-party code and specifications for the development of code or cloud providers fail to support our products or otherwise limit the functionality, compatibility or certification of our products or otherwise impose unfavorable terms and conditions, this could negatively impact our ability to develop compatible software. This could result in higher research and development costs for the enhancement and modification of our existing products or development of 

25


new products. Any additional restrictions could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and cash flow.

Failure to enter into software license agreements on a satisfactory basis could materially adversely affect our business.

Many of our existing software customers have multi-year enterprise software license agreements, some of which involve substantial aggregate fee amounts. These customers often do not have a contractual obligation to purchase additional solutions and often have termination for convenience clauses without payment of a substantive penalty. The failure or inability to renew customer agreements of similar scope, on terms that are commercially attractive to us, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and cash flow, or software license agreements without termination for convenience clauses could cause our operating results to fluctuate.

Our use of open source software in certain products and services could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.

Many of our products and services incorporate open source software, the use of which may subject us to certain conditions, including the obligation to offer such products for no cost or to make the proprietary source code of those products publicly available. Open source licenses are generally “as-is” and do not provide warranties, support or assurance of title or controls on origin, which may expose us to potential liability if the software fails to work or has security vulnerabilities. 

Although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to unintended conditions and security vulnerabilities, we may receive third-party claims regarding our compliance with the conditions of such open source licenses and we may be required to take steps to remedy an alleged infringement or noncompliance, including modifying or releasing our product code or paying damages. 

Our sales to government customers subject us to uncertainties and governmental regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our contracts signed with the U.S. federal, state and local government and non-U.S. government agencies are generally subject to annual fiscal funding approval and may be renegotiated or terminated at the discretion of the government. Termination, renegotiation or the lack of funding approval for a contract could adversely affect our sales, revenue and reputation. Additionally, our government contracts and our arrangements with channel partners who may sell directly to government customers are generally subject to requirements that may generally not be present in commercial contracts and/or may be complex, as well as audits and investigations. Failure to meet contractual requirements could result in various civil and criminal actions and penalties, and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.

Failure to effectively manage our products and services lifecycles could harm our business.

As part of the natural lifecycle of our products and services, customers are informed when products or services will be reaching their end of life or end of availability and will no longer be supported or receive updates and security patches. If these products or services remain subject to a service contract, the customer may transition to alternative products or services. Failure to effectively manage our products and services lifecycles could lead to customer dissatisfaction and contractual liabilities, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.

Our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations.

Our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and annual basis and are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to many of the risks described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, these factors include, among others:

•the timing of launches by our customers of new products in which our products are included and changes in end-user demand for our customers’ products;

•fluctuations in the levels of component or product inventories held by our customers, which may lead to increased requests to delay shipment of our semiconductor products;

•the shift to cloud-based IT solutions and services, such as hyperscale computing, which may adversely affect the timing and volume of sales of our semiconductor products for use in traditional enterprise data centers;

•the timing and extent of our software license and subscription revenue, and other non-product revenue;

•the timing of new software contracts and renewals, including the timing of software contracts that do not have termination for convenience clauses;

26


•the timing of any terminations of software contracts that require us to refund to customers any pre-paid amounts under the contract;

•the timing of contracts with distributors and channel partners to lead go-to-market and customer relationships for certain products;

•our ability to timely develop, introduce and market new products and technologies;

•new product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors;

•seasonality or other fluctuations in demand in our markets;

•timing and amount of research and development and related new product expenditures, and the timing of receipt of any research and development grant monies; and

•timing of any regulatory changes, particularly with respect to trade sanctions and customs duties and tariffs, and tax reform, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing requirements.

The foregoing factors are often difficult to predict, and these, as well as other factors, could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results. In addition, a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature. Any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations. As a result, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful or reliable indicators of our future performance. If our operating results in one or more future quarters fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, a significant decline in the trading price of our common stock may occur, which may happen immediately or over time.

Competition in our industries could prevent us from growing our revenue.

The industries in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements, often aggressive pricing practices and, in some cases, new delivery methods. We expect competition in these industries to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings or as new competitors enter our markets. In addition, the trend toward consolidation is changing the competitive landscape. We expect this trend to continue, which may result in combined competitors having greater resources than us. 

Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition or presence in key markets, a larger installed customer base, larger technical staff, a more comprehensive IP portfolio or better patent protection, more established relationships with vendors or suppliers, or greater manufacturing, distribution, financial, research and development, technical and marketing resources than us. We face competition from companies that receive financial and other support from their home country government, customers who develop competing products, public cloud providers, numerous smaller companies that specialize in specific aspects of the highly fragmented software industry, open source authors who provide software and IP for free, and competitors who offer their products through try-and-buy or freemium models.

The actions of our competitors, in the areas of pricing and product bundling in particular, could have a substantial adverse impact on us. Further, competitors may leverage their superior market position, as well as IP or other proprietary information, including interface, interoperability or technical information, in new and emerging technologies and platforms that may inhibit our ability to compete effectively. If we are unable to compete successfully, we may lose market share for our products or incur significant reduction in our gross margins, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Our gross margin is dependent on a number of factors, including our product mix, price erosion, acquisitions we may make, level of capacity utilization and commodity prices.

Our gross margin is highly dependent on product mix, which is susceptible to seasonal and other fluctuations in our markets. A shift in sales mix away from our higher margin products, as well as the timing and amount of our software licensing and non-product revenue, could adversely affect our future gross margin percentages. In addition, increased competition and the existence of product alternatives, more complex engineering requirements, lower demand, industry oversupply or reductions in our technological lead compared to our competitors, and other factors have in the past and may in the future lead to further price erosion, lower revenue and lower margin. Conversely, periods of robust demand that create a supply imbalance can lead to higher gross margins that may not be sustainable over the longer term.

27


We utilize a significant amount of IP in our business. If we are unable or fail to protect our IP, our business could be adversely affected.

Our success depends in part upon protecting our IP. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of IP rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as customary contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants. We spend significant resources to monitor and protect our IP rights, including the unauthorized use of our products and usage rates of the software seat licenses and subscriptions that we sell. Even with significant expenditures, we may not be able to protect the IP rights that are valuable to our business or have sufficient IP rights to protect our products or our business. Further, effective IP protection may be unavailable or more limited in other jurisdictions, relative to those protections available in the U.S., and may not be applied for or may be abandoned in one or more relevant jurisdictions. In addition, when patents expire, we lose the protection and competitive advantages they provided to us.

We also generate revenue from licensing royalty payments and from technology claim settlements relating to certain of our IP. Licensing of our IP rights, particularly exclusive licenses, may limit our ability to assert those IP rights against third parties, including the licensee of those rights. In addition, from time to time, we acquire companies with IP that is subject to licensing obligations to other third parties. These licensing obligations have extended, and may in the future extend, to our own IP, limiting our ability to assert our IP rights. 

From time to time, we pursue litigation to assert our IP rights, including, in some cases, against our customers and suppliers. Claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. Conversely, third parties have and may in the future pursue IP litigation against us, including as a result of our IP licensing business. Any inability to adequately protect our IP could limit the value of our technology, result in the loss of opportunities to sell or license our technology to others or limit our collection of royalty payments, any of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, from time to time, we obtain or renew IP licenses. Our inability to obtain or renew these licenses on acceptable terms, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

We are subject to warranty claims, product recalls and product liability.

From time to time, we may be subject to warranty or product liability claims that may lead to significant expense. Our customer contracts typically contain warranty and indemnification provisions, and in certain cases may also contain liquidated damages provisions. The potential liabilities associated with such provisions are significant, and in some cases, including in agreements with some of our largest customers, are potentially unlimited. Any such liabilities may greatly exceed any revenue we receive from the relevant products. Costs, payments or damages incurred or paid by us in connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We may also be exposed to such claims as a result of any acquisition we may undertake in the future. Product liability insurance is subject to significant deductibles and there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims, or we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. Although we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liabilities and purchase product liability insurance, our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claims. 

The complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expense or undetected defects or bugs, which could adversely affect the market acceptance of new products, damage our reputation with current or prospective customers, and materially and adversely affect our operating costs.

Highly complex products, such as those we offer, may contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions, software documentation or enhancements are released, or their release may be delayed due to unforeseen difficulties during product development. If any of our products or third-party components used in our products, contain defects or bugs, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, we may not be able to successfully design workarounds. Furthermore, if any of these problems are not discovered until after we have commenced commercial production or deployment, we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall, repair or replacement costs. Significant technical challenges also arise with our software products because our customers license and deploy our products across a variety of computer platforms and integrate them with a number of third-party software applications and databases. As a result, if there is system-wide failure or an actual or perceived breach of information integrity, security or availability occurs in one of our end-user customer’s system, it can be difficult to determine which product is at fault and we could ultimately be harmed by the failure of another supplier’s product. Consequently, our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products and we may have to invest significant capital and other resources, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers. As a result, our financial results could be materially adversely affected.

28


We collect, use, store, or otherwise process personal information, which subjects us to privacy and data security laws and contractual commitments, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws and commitments could harm our business.

We collect, use and store (collectively referred to as “process” in this paragraph) a high volume, variety and velocity of certain personal information in connection with the operation of our business. This creates various levels of privacy risks across different parts of our business, depending on the type of personal information, the jurisdiction in question and the purpose of their processing. The personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security, as well as contractual commitments. Privacy legislation and other data protection regulations, enforcement and policy activity in this area are expanding rapidly in many jurisdictions and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Sectoral legislation, certification requirements and technical standards applying to certain categories of our customers, such as those in the financial services or public sector, have exacerbated this trend. The cost of complying with and implementing these privacy-related and data governance measures could increase depending on any additional burdensome security, business processes, or business record or data localization requirements. Concerns about government interference, sovereignty and expanding privacy, cybersecurity and data governance legislation could adversely affect our customers and our products and services, particularly in cloud computing, AI and our own data management practices. The theft, loss or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Any inadvertent failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy, data governance or cybersecurity obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, substantial fines and damages, and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.

Environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters may adversely affect our relationships with customers and investors and increase compliance costs.

There is an increasing focus from lawmakers, regulators, investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders concerning ESG matters, including environment, climate, water, diversity and inclusion, human rights and governance transparency. A number of our customers have adopted, or may adopt, procurement policies that include ESG provisions or requirements that their suppliers should comply with, or they may seek to include such provisions or requirements in their procurement terms and conditions. An increasing number of investors are also requiring companies to disclose ESG-related policies, practices and metrics. In addition, various jurisdictions have adopted, or are developing, complex and lengthy ESG-related laws or regulations that may be difficult to comply with and will increase our direct compliance costs, as well as indirect costs passed on to us from our customers and suppliers. Further, there is an increasing number of state-level anti-ESG initiatives in the United States that may conflict with other regulatory requirements or our various stakeholders’ expectations. If we fail to materially comply with or meet the evolving legal and regulatory requirements or expectations of our various stakeholders, we may be subject to enforcement actions, required to pay fines, face decreased customer demand or lose investors, which could harm our reputation, revenue and results of operations. Our actual or perceived failure to achieve our publicly disclosed ESG-related initiatives could negatively impact our reputation, subject us to litigation or enforcement actions, or otherwise harm our business.

In addition, an increasing number of OEMs are seeking to source products that do not contain conflict minerals. This could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, including our products. As a result, we may face difficulties in satisfying our customers’ demands, which may harm our sales and operating results.

We must comply with technical standards and a variety of domestic and international laws and regulations in the manufacture and distribution of our semiconductors, the costs of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The manufacture and distribution of our semiconductors must comply with technical standards and a variety of domestic and international laws and regulations, including those related to the materials composition of our semiconductor products, and the use, disposal, clean-up of and human exposure to hazardous materials. This could increase the complexity and costs of our product design and procurement operations, require us to stop distributing our products commercially until they comply with such new standards, lead our customers to suspend imports of their products into that country, require us to re-engineer our products and disrupt cross-border manufacturing relationships. In addition, we may be required to modify our manufacturing process or equipment, or be restricted in our ability to expand our facilities. Any failure by us to comply with such requirements could result in litigation against us and the payment of significant fines and damages by us in the event of a significant adverse judgment. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Complying with any cleanup or remediation obligations for which we are or become responsible could also be costly and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

29


Risks Related to Our Taxes

Our income taxes and overall cash tax costs are affected by a number of factors that could have a material, adverse effect on our financial results.

Our income taxes are subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including reorganization or restructuring of our business, tax structure, business combinations, jurisdictional mix of our income and assets, and changes in tax legislation or accounting policies or related interpretations. 

As a result of U.S. tax reforms, our global income is subject to tax in the U.S. and we expect an increase in our effective tax rate and our cash tax costs. In addition, many countries are implementing anti-base-erosion legislation and guidance aimed at standardizing and modernizing global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices. Many countries have implemented or are in the process of implementing a global minimum tax, which may materially increase our effective tax rate and cash tax costs. For example, Singapore recently adopted the global minimum tax, which will be effective for our fiscal year 2026. Substantial changes in domestic or international corporate tax policies, regulations or guidance, enforcement activities or legislative investigations and inquiries may materially adversely affect our business and impact our provision for income taxes, net income, cash flow and our results of operations generally. 

Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income taxes, and our calculations of income taxes payable currently and on a deferred basis are based on our interpretations of applicable tax laws. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of our income tax liability will not be materially different than what is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. In addition, we are subject to, and are under, tax audits in various jurisdictions. Although we believe our tax positions are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our income tax provisions and accruals, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.

As a result of the VMware Merger, we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions for the Dell Technologies, Inc. (“Dell”) consolidated group, of which VMware was a member beginning in Dell’s fiscal year 2017 until November 2021. While VMware is no longer a member of the Dell consolidated group, it is still subject to audit for the periods in which it was member of the Dell consolidated group. While we believe VMware’s positions are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our income tax provisions and accruals. Further, pursuant to a tax agreement between VMware and Dell, in the event VMware becomes subject to audits as a member of Dell’s consolidated group, Dell has authority to control the audit and represent Dell and our interests, which could limit our ability to affect the outcome of such audits.

If our tax incentives or tax holiday arrangements change or cease to be in effect or applicable, our corporate income taxes could significantly increase.

Our operations benefit from the various tax incentives extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment. Each tax incentive and tax holiday is subject to our compliance with various conditions and may, in some instances, be amended or terminated prior to their scheduled termination date by the relevant governmental authority. If we cannot, or elect not to, comply with the conditions related to our tax incentive or tax holiday, we could be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits. If such tax incentive or tax holiday is modified or terminated prior to its expiration absent a new incentive applying, we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences, which would increase our expenses, reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows. In addition, we may be required, or elect, to modify our operational structure and tax strategy in order to keep an incentive, which could result in a decrease in the benefits of the incentive. Adoption of global minimum tax provisions in a country in which we have an existing tax incentive could have a material adverse impact on our tax incentives. Our tax incentives and tax holiday, before taking into consideration U.S. foreign tax credits, decreased the provision for income taxes by approximately $2,261 million in the aggregate and increased diluted net income per share by $0.47 for fiscal year 2024.

Our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority, and if our assumptions and interpretations are incorrect, the benefits of the tax incentives may be adversely affected.

We have potential tax liabilities as a result of VMware’s former controlling ownership by Dell, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.

If the VMware spin-off from Dell in November 2021 is determined to not be tax-free for any reason, we could be liable for all or a portion of the tax liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Further, if the VMware Merger results in the spin-off failing to qualify as a tax-free transaction under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code, Dell, its affiliates and, potentially, its stockholders would incur significant tax liabilities and we may be required to indemnify Dell and its affiliates for any such tax liabilities, which could be material.

Risks Related to Our Indebtedness

Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to execute our business strategy.

As of November 3, 2024, the aggregate indebtedness was $69,847 million. Our substantial indebtedness and the instruments governing our indebtedness could have important consequences including:

•increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions;

•exposing us to interest rate risk as our 2023 Term Loans bear floating interest rates;

•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the economy and the industries in which we operate;

•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness; 

•making it more difficult to borrow additional funds in the future to fund growth, acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures and other purposes; and

•potentially requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund our other business needs.

We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the U.S., and any downgrade in our credit rating or the ratings of our indebtedness, or adverse conditions in the debt capital markets, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Related to Owning Our Common Stock

Our stock price has been, and may in the future be, volatile and your investment could lose value.

The trading price of our common stock has, at times, fluctuated significantly and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to any of the risk factors listed in this “Risk Factors” section, and others, including:

•issuance of new or updated research or other reports by securities analysts;

•anticipated or actual demand for AI-related products, including ASICs such as custom AI accelerators or XPUs;

•broad market, industry and competitor-related fluctuations;

•unsubstantiated news reports or other inaccurate publicity regarding us or our business;

•fluctuations in the valuation and results of operations of our significant customers as well as companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;

•announcements of proposed acquisitions by us or our competitors;

•announcements of, or expectations of, additional debt or equity financing transactions;

•hedging or arbitrage trading activity involving our common stock; and

•significant sales of our common stock by one or more of our largest investors.

These fluctuations are often unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. Broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. You may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. In addition, we have been, and in the future we may be, subject to lawsuits stemming from our acquisitions. Securities litigation against us, including the lawsuits related to such acquisitions, could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.

There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends.

Our Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we currently pay a cash dividend on our common stock on a quarterly basis. The declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our Board of Directors and our dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any time. Because we are a holding company, our ability to pay cash dividends is also limited by restrictions or limitations on our ability to obtain sufficient funds through dividends from subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts, or at all. A reduction in our cash dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price.
