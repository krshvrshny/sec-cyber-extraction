Item 1C. Cybersecurity.

At Lucid, cybersecurity risk management is an integral part of our overall enterprise risk management program. We have made significant investments in people, processes, and technology to protect Lucid’s connected vehicles, services, confidential business information, and employee and consumer personal data. We have implemented multiple and varied processes and technologies for the avoidance, identification, assessment, mitigation, and remediation of risks from cybersecurity threats and incidents designated to protect against the cybersecurity risk landscape. We are continuously assessing and enhancing our protection, detection, response, and recovery capabilities and regularly engage with the cybersecurity communities including Auto-ISAC, third-party cybersecurity and compliance partners, internal stakeholders, and organizations leading best practices, to support our goals and objectives. At its core, our cybersecurity risk management program integrates multiple teams across the organization, including our IT, digital and physical product, infrastructure, and legal teams, with leadership and oversight by executive management, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (“Audit Committee”), and the Board of Directors (“Board”). 

Governance

Board and Committee Oversight

Our Board has oversight responsibility for our overall enterprise risk management and delegates cybersecurity risk management oversight to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee oversees Lucid’s policies and practices with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including discussing with management (i) Lucid’s major financial, cybersecurity, privacy and other information technology risk exposures; (ii) the steps that have been taken to monitor and control such exposures; and (iii) any material cybersecurity threats or incidents. The Audit Committee and the Board receive regular reporting from Lucid’s management, including our Senior Director of Security and Compliance and Senior Director of Cybersecurity, Data, and Connectivity, on the status of our cybersecurity program and ad hoc reporting on material cybersecurity threats and incidents. 

Management’s Role

At the management level, our information security steering committee, with oversight by our VP of IT and General Counsel, is responsible for leading our cybersecurity risk management program and enterprise cybersecurity matters. Under the information security steering committee, we have a cybersecurity risk and compliance committee, led by our Senior Director of Security and Compliance and Senior Director of Cybersecurity, Data, and Connectivity, which is primarily responsible for operational review of cybersecurity threats and incidents as part of our incident response process. The cybersecurity risk and compliance committee receives reports from our cybersecurity team and monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity threats and incidents. For potentially material cybersecurity threats and incidents, we escalate these to the information security steering committee, which, with additional oversight and support from our CEO, would raise such threats and incidents to our Audit Committee Chair and, as appropriate, to our Board as they arise.

Our Senior Director of Security and Compliance and Senior Director of Cybersecurity, Data, and Connectivity, and the dedicated personnel on their teams have industry-recognized certifications such as Certified Information Security Manager, Certified information systems security professional, and Boardroom qualified Technology Expert, and experienced information systems security professionals and information security managers with many years of technical cybersecurity management experience. 

Management of Cybersecurity Risk

Our Cybersecurity Risk Management Processes

Our cybersecurity risk management program provides a framework for handling cybersecurity threats and incidents by escalating risks, issues, and key decisions to management, the Audit Committee, and our Board. Our program is designated to protect our products and services, confidential business information (including intellectual property), and employee and consumer data and includes steps for detecting and monitoring cybersecurity threats and incidents, assessing the severity of such threats or incidents, identifying the source of such threats or incidents, including whether such threats or incidents are associated with a third-party vendor or service provider, implementing cybersecurity countermeasures and mitigation strategies and informing management, the Audit Committee, and our Board of potentially material cybersecurity threats and incidents. In addition, our cybersecurity team provides cybersecurity training to employees during the onboarding process and periodic basis thereafter, with specialized training and tabletop exercises for our core incident response teams and executive management on at least an annual basis.

69

Under the oversight of the information security steering committee, our cybersecurity risk management program is implemented day-to-day by our cybersecurity team, who engage in identifying, considering and assessing risks from cybersecurity threats and incidents on an ongoing basis; establishing processes to monitor such cybersecurity risks; putting in place mitigation and remediation measures; policy review and development; product support and deployment; and maintaining our cybersecurity measures. Our cybersecurity team also implements ongoing data loss prevention tools and capabilities, customer security measures, incident response measures, and processes for management of third-party vendors and service providers. Cybersecurity incident response is driven by our Lucid Data and Security Incident Response Plan. Based upon the severity assessment and ranking, incidents are handled by the relevant teams for technical, operational, and legal risk management. 

Lucid has also implemented processes to integrate our cybersecurity risk management processes into our overall enterprise risk management system including within our greater product management, personnel management, and third-party vendor and service provider management processes.

Third-Party Auditors and Consultants in Cybersecurity Risk Management

Our cybersecurity team also periodically engages third-party cybersecurity experts for risk assessment and system enhancements. We utilize third-party auditors and assessors in connection with our cybersecurity risk management program to identify gaps and develop policies, procedures, and strategies designed to improve the program posture. We also use third-party consultants to obtain and will use them to maintain relevant organizational cybersecurity certifications, including UN Regulation 155 Vehicle Cybersecurity Approval. As a general matter, we have from time-to-time utilized third-party cybersecurity consultants on an ad hoc basis in specific instances, including (i) to address potential cybersecurity threats and incidents, (ii) to conduct cybersecurity assessments and penetration testing on high value systems and applications; and (iii) to develop internal capabilities to improve our cybersecurity defense.

Cybersecurity Risk Management of Third-Party Vendors and Service Providers

We have also implemented risk management practices designed to minimize the material cybersecurity risks that arise from utilizing third-party vendors and service providers that receive or have access to Lucid confidential information or personal data. In order to oversee and identify such risks, we have implemented the following processes: (i) a third-party security risk management program designed to assess security risk of new third-party vendors or service providers and develop countermeasures to manage unacceptable risks; (ii) provisions in our third-party vendors and service provider contracts with added security requirements; (iii) training procurement teams on management of third-party vendor and service providers; (iv) role-based access controls for third-party personnel; and (v) data transfer mechanisms for the sharing of data with third parties. While we are in the process of increasing the resiliency of these capabilities across the board, our control over and ability to monitor the security posture of third-party vendors and service providers remains limited and there can be no assurance that we can prevent, mitigate or remediate the risk of any compromise or failure in the security infrastructure owned or controlled by such third parties. Additionally, any contractual protections with such third parties, including our right to indemnification, if any at all, may be limited or insufficient to prevent a negative impact on our business from such compromise or failure.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion and analysis provides information that Lucid management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of Lucid’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition as of December 31, 2023 and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Annual Report”). For discussion related to our financial condition as of December 31, 2022, results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 and year to year comparison between the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, refer to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed on February 28, 2023 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon Lucid’s current expectations, estimates and projections that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.

Overview

We are a technology company with a mission to inspire the adoption of sustainable energy by creating advanced technologies and the most captivating luxury electric vehicles, centered around the human experience. Our focus on in-house hardware and software innovation, vertical integration, and a “clean sheet” approach to engineering and design led to the development of the award-winning Lucid Air. 

We sell vehicles directly to consumers through our retail sales network and through direct online sales including through Lucid Financial Services. We believe that owning our sales network provides an opportunity to closely manage the customer experience, gather direct customer feedback, and ensure that customer interactions are tailored to our customers’ needs. We own and operate a vehicle service network comprised of service centers in major metropolitan areas and a fleet of mobile service vehicles. In addition to our in-house service capabilities, we established and continue to grow an approved list of specially trained collision repair shops which also serve as repair hubs for our mobile service offerings in some cases. 

74

We began delivering the Lucid Air to customers in October 2021 and we expect to launch additional vehicles over the coming decade. We have leveraged and expanded the technological advancements from the Lucid Air to the Lucid Gravity, a luxury sport utility vehicle (“SUV”), which  is scheduled for start of production in late 2024. After the Lucid Air and the Lucid Gravity, start of production of our Midsize platform is scheduled for late 2026.

Recent Development

Implementation Agreement with Aston Martin

In June 2023, we entered into an agreement (the “Implementation Agreement”) with Aston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings plc (together with its subsidiaries, “Aston Martin”), a related party of PIF, which is an affiliate of Ayar, under which we and Aston Martin have established a long-term strategic technology and supply arrangement. On November 6, 2023, pursuant to the terms of the Implementation Agreement, integration and supply arrangements became effective, under which we will provide Aston Martin access to our powertrain, battery system, and software technologies, work with Aston Martin to integrate our powertrain and battery components with Aston Martin’s battery electric vehicle chassis, and supply powertrain and battery components to Aston Martin (collectively, the “Strategic Technology Arrangement”). In connection with the commencement of the Strategic Technology Arrangement, we received technology access fees in 28,352,273 ordinary shares of Aston Martin (subject to a lock-up provision of 365 days from its issuance) and the first cash installment of $33 million. These shares were initially measured at a fair value of $73.2 million and subsequently remeasured to fair value of $81.5 million as of December 31, 2023. We will receive the remaining cash payments of $99 million phased over a period of three years. In connection with the Strategic Technology Arrangement, we will also receive an aggregate of $10 million for integration service fees phased over a period of three years, of which we received $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. Aston Martin has also committed to an effective minimum spend with us on powertrain components of $225 million.

EV Purchase Agreement

In August 2023, Lucid LLC entered into an EV purchase agreement with the Government of Saudi Arabia, a related party of PIF, which is an affiliate of Ayar, as represented by the Ministry of Finance (the “EV Purchase Agreement”), which supersedes the letter of undertaking that Lucid LLC entered into in April 2022. Pursuant to the terms of the EV Purchase Agreement, the Government of Saudi Arabia and its entities and corporate subsidiaries and other beneficiaries (collectively, the “Purchaser”) may purchase up to 100,000 vehicles, with a minimum purchase quantity of 50,000 vehicles and an option to purchase up to an additional 50,000 vehicles during a ten-year period. Under the EV Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser may reduce the minimum vehicle purchase quantity by the number of vehicles set out in any purchase order not accepted by us or by the number of vehicles that Lucid LLC fails to deliver within six months from the date of the applicable purchase order. The Purchaser also has absolute discretion to decide whether to exercise the option to purchase the additional 50,000 vehicles.

Potential Impact of an Economic Downturn on our Business

A global economic recession or other downturn, whether due to inflation, global conflicts or other geopolitical events, COVID-19 or other public health crises, interest rate increases or other policy actions by major central banks, government closures of banks and liquidity concerns at other financial institutions, or other factors, may have an adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Adverse economic conditions as well as uncertainty about the current and future global economic conditions may cause our customers to defer purchases or cancel their reservations and orders in response to higher interest rates, availability of consumer credit, decreased cash availability, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and weakened consumer confidence. Reduced demand for our products may result in significant decreases in our product sales, which in turn would have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Because of our premium brand positioning and pricing, an economic downturn is likely to have a heightened adverse effect on us compared to many of our electric vehicle and traditional automotive industry competitors, to the extent that consumer demand for luxury goods is reduced in favor of lower-priced alternatives. In addition, an economic recession or other downturn could also cause logistical challenges and other operational risks if any of our suppliers, sub-suppliers or partners become insolvent or are otherwise unable to continue their operations, fulfill their obligations to us, or meet our future demand. In addition, the deterioration of conditions in global credit markets may limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures on terms favorable to us, if at all. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report for more information regarding risks associated with a global economic recession, including under the caption “A global economic recession, government closures of banks and liquidity concerns at other financial institutions, or other downturn may have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.” 

Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 

We believe that our future success and financial performance depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for our business, but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below and in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report.

75

Design and Technology Leadership 

We believe that we are positioned to be a leader in the electric vehicle market by unlocking the potential for advanced, high-performance, and long-range electric vehicles to co-exist. The Lucid Air is designed with race-proven battery and powertrain technologies and robust performance together with a sleek exterior design and expansive interior space given our miniaturized key drivetrain components. We anticipated continued consumer demand for the Lucid Air based on its luxurious design, high-performance technology and sustainability leadership, and the growing acceptance of and demand for electric vehicles as a substitute for gasoline-fueled vehicles. We continue to receive significant interest in the Lucid Air from potential customers.

Direct-to-Consumer Model 

We operate a direct-to-consumer sales and service model, which we believe allows us to offer a personalized experience for our customers based on their purchase and ownership preferences. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses in our sales, service and marketing operations for sale of the Lucid Air, including to open studios, hire a sales force, invest in marketing and brand awareness, and establish a robust service center operation. As of December 31, 2023, we have opened forty-five studios and service centers (excluding temporary and satellite service centers): thirty-three in the United States (ten in California, four in each of Florida and New York, two in each of Arizona, Illinois, Massachusetts, Texas, Virginia and Washington, and one in each of Colorado, Michigan and New Jersey), five in Canada, two in Germany, one in Netherlands, one in Norway, one in Switzerland, and two in Saudi Arabia. We also expect to hire additional sales, customer service, and service center personnel. We believe that investing in our direct-to-consumer sales and service model will be critical to deliver and service the Lucid electric vehicles we manufacture and sell. 

Establishing Manufacturing Capacity 

Achieving commercialization and growth for each generation of electric vehicles requires us to make significant capital expenditures to scale our production capacity and improve our supply chain processes in the United States and internationally. We expect our capital expenditures to increase as we continue our expansion of AMP-1 and construction of the completely-built-up (“CBU”) portion of AMP-2. The amount and timing of our future manufacturing capacity requirements, and resulting capital expenditures, will depend on many factors, including the pace and results of our research and development efforts to meet technological development milestones, our ability to develop and launch new electric vehicles, our ability to achieve sales and experience customer demand for our vehicles at the levels we anticipate, our ability to utilize planned capacity in our existing facilities and our ability to enter new markets. 

Technology Innovation

We develop in-house battery and powertrain technology, which requires us to invest a significant amount of capital in research and development. The electric vehicle market is highly competitive and includes both established automotive manufacturers and new entrants. To establish market share and attract customers from competitors, we plan to continue to make substantial investments in research and development for the commercialization and continued enhancements of the Lucid Air, the development of the Lucid Gravity, and future generations of our electric vehicles and other products.

Inflationary Pressure

The U.S. and Saudi Arabia economies have experienced increased inflation, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our cost to manufacture a vehicle is heavily influenced by the cost of the key components and materials used in the vehicle, cost of labor, as well as cost of equipment used in our manufacturing facilities. As we continue our phased construction of our AMP-1 and AMP-2 facilities, any further increases in material and infrastructure equipment prices and cost of construction labor could lead to higher capital expenditures.

Results of Operations

Revenue 

The following table presents our revenue for the periods presented (in thousands):

Year Ended December 31,

20232022$ Change% Change

Revenue$595,271 $608,181 $(12,910)(2)%

We recognize vehicle sales when the customer obtains control of the vehicle, which is upon delivery. We also generate revenue from non-warranty after-sales vehicle services and parts, powertrain kits, retail merchandise, and regulatory credits.

76

Revenue decreased by $12.9 million, or 2% for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by change in product mix, pricing and incentives offered, partially offset by increases in deliveries of the Lucid Air vehicles during the year ended December 31, 2023.

Cost of Revenue

The following table presents our cost of revenue for the periods presented (in thousands):

Year Ended December 31,

20232022$ Change% Change

Cost of revenue$1,936,066 $1,646,086 $289,980 18 %

Cost of vehicle sales includes direct parts, materials, shipping and handling costs, allocable overhead costs such as depreciation of manufacturing related equipment and facilities, information technology costs, personnel costs, including wages and stock-based compensation, estimated warranty costs, charges to reduce inventories to their net realizable value, charges for any excess or obsolete inventories, and losses from firm purchase commitments.

Cost of other revenue includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation of tooling costs, shipping and logistic costs. Cost of other revenue also includes costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services and costs for retail merchandise.

Cost of revenue increased by $290.0 million, or 18% for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the increases in the manufacture and sale of the Lucid Air vehicles in 2023 and inventory and firm purchase commitments write-downs. We incurred significant personnel and overhead costs to operate our large-scale manufacturing facilities while ramping up production. In the near term, we expect our production volume of vehicles to continue to be significantly less than our manufacturing capacity. 

We recorded write-downs of $926.9 million and $569.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, to reduce our inventories to their net realizable values, for any excess or obsolete inventories, and losses from firm purchase commitments. We expect inventory write-downs could negatively affect our costs of vehicle sales in upcoming periods in the near term as we ramp production volumes up toward our manufacturing capacity.

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) was enacted with clean energy incentives. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the impact of the IRA on our results of operations was not material. We will continue to evaluate the expected future impact of the IRA on our business and financial statements as additional regulatory guidance is issued.

Research and Development 

Our research and development efforts have primarily focused on the development of our battery and powertrain technology, the Lucid Air, the Lucid Gravity, and future generations of our electric vehicles. Research and development expenses consist primarily of materials, supplies and personnel-related expenses for employees involved in the engineering, designing, and testing of electric vehicles. Personnel-related expenses primarily include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation. Research and development expenses also include prototype material, engineering, design and testing services, and allocated facilities costs, such as office and rent expense and depreciation expense, and other engineering, designing and testing expenses.

77

Research and development expense increased by $115.5 million, or 14% for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $89.4 million for prototype material, engineering, design and testing services and higher personnel-related expenses of $46.1 million ($59.9 million increase due to our growth in headcount, partially offset by $13.8 million lower stock-based compensation expense), partially offset by a decrease of $23.4 million from lower utilization of contractors and professional fees.

Selling, General, and Administrative 

Selling, general, and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses for employees involved in general corporate, selling and marketing functions, including executive management and administration, legal, human resources, facilities and real estate, accounting, finance, tax, and information technology. Personnel-related expenses primarily include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation. Selling, general, and administrative expenses also include allocated facilities costs, such as office, rent and depreciation expenses, professional services fees and other general corporate expenses. As we continue to grow as a company, build out our sales force, and commercialize the Lucid Air and planned future generations of our electric vehicles, we expect that our selling, general and administrative costs will increase. 

We are incurring additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses necessary to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange and related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, as well as higher expenses for general and director and officer insurance, investor relations, and professional services. 

Selling, general, and administrative expense increased by $62.7 million, or 9% for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in allocated facilities costs of $61.2 million, sales and marketing expenses of $22.7 million and other general corporate expenses of $17.5 million, partially offset by lower personnel-related expenses of $37.3 million ($112.8 million lower stock-based compensation expense mainly driven by the vesting of the four tranches of CEO performance-based awards during the year ended December 31, 2022, partially offset by $75.5 million increase due to our growth in headcount).

Restructuring Charges

On March 28, 2023, we announced a restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”) intended to reduce operating expenses in response to evolving business needs and productivity improvement through a reduction in workforce. We substantially completed the Restructuring Plan in 2023.

Restructuring charges of $24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily related to severance payments, employee benefits, employee transition and stock-based compensation, net of a reversal of previously recognized stock-based compensation expense.

Change in Fair Value of Common Stock Warrant Liability 

Our common stock warrant liability relates to the privately placed common stock warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to purchase shares of Lucid Group common stock that were effectively issued upon the Closing in connection with the reverse recapitalization treatment of the Merger. Our common stock warrant liability is subject to remeasurement to fair value at each balance sheet date. Changes in the fair value of our common stock warrant liability were recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

78

The Private Placement Warrants remained unexercised as of December 31, 2023. The liability was remeasured to fair value, resulting in gains of $86.9 million and $1,254.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and was classified within change in fair value of common stock warrant liability in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. See Note 10 “Common Stock Warrant Liability” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information.

Change in Fair Value of Equity Securities

In connection with the commencement of the Strategic Technology Arrangement with Aston Martin, the Company received 28,352,273 ordinary shares of Aston Martin (subject to a lock-up provision of 365 days from its issuance). The ordinary shares of Aston Martin are subject to remeasurement to fair value at each balance sheet date. Such shares were initially measured at a fair value of $73.2 million and subsequently remeasured to fair value of $81.5 million as of December 31, 2023. The change in fair value resulted in an unrealized gain of $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, and was classified within change in fair value of equity securities in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. See Note 6 “Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments” and Note 20 “Related Party Transactions” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information.

Interest Income

Interest income increased by $147.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to higher book yield from our investments in available-for-sale securities under the investment program which started in June 2022.

Interest Expense

Interest expense primarily consists of contractual interest and amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs incurred related to the 2026 Notes issued in December 2021, commitment fees and amortization of deferred issuance costs from the five-year senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (“ABL Credit Facility”), interest from GIB credit facility and on our finance leases, and capitalized interest on construction in progress related to significant capital asset construction.

Interest expense decreased by $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase of $9.7 million in interest capitalized on construction in progress related to significant capital asset construction, partially offset by increases of $3.6 million in interest expense from the GIB credit facility, and commitment fees and amortization of deferred issuance costs from the ABL Credit Facility.

Other Income (Expense), net

Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses and dividend income from our investments. Our foreign currency exchange gains and losses relate to transactions and monetary asset and liability balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We expect our foreign currency gains and losses to continue to fluctuate in the future due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Other income (expense), net decreased by $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to dividend income earned from our investments in 2022.

Provision for Income Taxes 

The following table presents our provision for income taxes for the periods presented (in thousands):

Year Ended December 31,

20232022$ Change% Change

Provision for income taxes$1,026 $379 $647 171 %

Our provision for income taxes consists primarily of U.S., state and foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which we operate. We maintain a valuation allowance against the full value of our U.S. and state net deferred tax assets because we believe it is more likely than not that the recoverability of these deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Sources of Liquidity

As of December 31, 2023, Lucid had $4.32 billion of cash, cash equivalents and investments. Since inception, our sources of cash are predominantly from proceeds received upon the completion of the Merger, the issuance of convertible debt and proceeds from equity offerings.

We expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our projection of cash flows from operating activities will provide us with adequate liquidity for at least the next 12 months, including investment in funding (i) ongoing operations, (ii) research and development projects for new products/ technologies, (iii) further construction of AMP-1 phase 2 in Casa Grande, Arizona, (iv) construction of AMP-2 CBU portion in Saudi Arabia, (v) expansion of retail studios and service centers, and (vi) other initiatives related to the sale of vehicles and/ or technology.

We anticipate our cumulative spending on capital expenditures to be approximately $1.5 billion for the fiscal year 2024 to support our continued commercialization and growth objectives as we strategically invest in manufacturing capacity and capabilities, our retail studios and service center capabilities throughout North America and across the globe, development of different products and technologies, and other areas supporting the growth of Lucid’s business. Our future capital expenditures may vary and will depend on many factors including the timing and extent of spending and other growth initiatives. In addition, we expect our operating expenses to increase in order to grow and support the operations of a global automotive company targeting volumes in line with Lucid’s aspirations.

As of December 31, 2023, our total minimum lease payments are $495.1 million, of which $65.2 million is due in fiscal year 2024. We also have non-cancellable long-term commitments of $4.9 billion, primarily relating to certain inventory component purchases. For details regarding these obligations, refer to Note 15 “Leases” and Note 16 “Commitments and Contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information. 

2026 Notes

In December 2021, we issued $2,012.5 million of the 2026 Notes. The 2026 Notes accrue interest at a rate of 1.25% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2022. The 2026 Notes will mature on December 15, 2026, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Before the close of business on the business day immediately before September 15, 2026, noteholders will have the right to convert their Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. From and after September 15, 2026, noteholders may convert their Notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. We will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. The initial conversion rate is 18.2548 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $54.78 per share of common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a “Make-Whole Fundamental Change” (as defined in the indenture) occur, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of time. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we were in compliance with applicable covenants under the indenture governing the 2026 Notes.

International Manufacturing Expansion

On February 27, 2022, we announced that we had selected King Abdullah Economic City (“KAEC”) in Saudi Arabia as the location of our first international manufacturing plant and signed related agreements with the Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia, the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, and the Economic City at KAEC. The operations at the new plant initially consist of re-assembly of the Lucid Air vehicle “kits” pre-manufactured in the U.S. and, over time, production of complete vehicles.

Saudi Industrial Development Fund (“SIDF”) Loan Agreement

On February 27, 2022, Lucid, LLC, a limited liability company established in Saudi Arabia and a subsidiary of the Company (“Lucid LLC”) entered into a loan agreement (as subsequently amended, the “SIDF Loan Agreement”) with SIDF, a related party of Public Investment Fund (“PIF”), which is an affiliate of Ayar. Under the SIDF Loan Agreement, SIDF has committed to provide loans (the “SIDF Loans”) to Lucid LLC in an aggregate principal amount of up to SAR 5.19 billion (approximately $1.4 billion); provided that SIDF may reduce the availability of SIDF Loans under the facility in certain circumstances. SIDF Loans will be subject to repayment in semi-annual installments in amounts ranging from SAR 25 million (approximately $6.7 million) to SAR 350 million (approximately $93.3 million), commencing on April 3, 2026 and ending on November 12, 2038. SIDF Loans are financing and will be used to finance certain costs in connection with the development and construction of AMP-2. Lucid LLC may repay SIDF Loans earlier than the maturity date without penalty. Obligations under the SIDF Loan Agreement do not extend to the Company or any of its other subsidiaries.

SIDF Loans will not bear interest. Instead, Lucid LLC will be required to pay SIDF service fees, consisting of follow-up and technical evaluation fees, ranging, in aggregate, from SAR 415 million (approximately $110.7 million) to SAR 1.77 billion (approximately $472.0 million), over the term of the SIDF Loans. SIDF Loans will be secured by security interests in the equipment, machines and assets funded thereby.

The SIDF Loan Agreement contains certain restrictive financial covenants and imposes annual caps on Lucid LLC’s payment of dividends, distributions of paid-in capital or certain capital expenditures. The SIDF Loan Agreement also defines customary events of default, including abandonment of or failure to commence operations at the plant in KAEC, and drawdowns under the SIDF Loan Agreement are subject to certain conditions precedent. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, no amount was outstanding under the SIDF Loan Agreement.

Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia (“MISA”) Agreements 

In February 2022, Lucid LLC entered into agreements with MISA, a related party of PIF, which is an affiliate of Ayar, pursuant to which MISA has agreed to provide economic support for certain capital expenditures in connection with Lucid LLC’s on-going design and construction of AMP-2. The support by MISA is subject to Lucid LLC’s completion of certain milestones related to the construction and operation of AMP-2. Following the commencement of construction, if operations at the plant do not commence within 30 months, or if the agreed scope of operations is not attained within 55 months, MISA may suspend availability of subsequent support. 

Pursuant to the agreements, MISA has the right to require Lucid LLC to transfer the ownership of AMP-2 to MISA, at the fair market value thereof, minus an amortized value of the support provided in the event of customary events of default including abandonment or material and chronically low utilization of AMP-2. Alternatively, Lucid LLC is entitled to avoid the transfer of the ownership of AMP-2 by electing to pay such amortized value. The agreements will terminate on the fifteenth anniversary of the commencement of CBU operations at AMP-2 at the latest.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, we received support of SAR 366 million (approximately $97.5 million) in cash, of which $62.5 million was recorded as deferred liability within other long-term liabilities and $35.0 million was recorded as a deduction in calculating the carrying amount of the related assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we received support of SAR 366 million (approximately $97.3 million) in cash, of which $64.0 million was recorded as deferred liability within other long-term liabilities and $33.3 million was recorded as a deduction in calculating the carrying amount of the related assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. Subsequently, we recorded $64.0 million as a deduction in calculating the carrying amount of the related assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. There were no unfulfilled conditions and contingencies attached to the payments received. 

81

Gulf International Bank (“GIB”) Facility Agreement

On April 29, 2022, Lucid LLC entered into a revolving credit facility agreement (the “GIB Facility Agreement”) with GIB, maturing on February 28, 2025. GIB is a related party of PIF, which is an affiliate of Ayar. The GIB Facility Agreement provided for two committed revolving credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of SAR 1 billion (approximately $266.1 million). SAR 650 million (approximately $173.0 million) under the GIB Facility Agreement was available as bridge financing (the “Bridge Facility”) of Lucid LLC’s capital expenditures in connection with AMP-2. The remaining SAR 350 million (approximately $93.1 million) might be used for general corporate purposes (the “Working Capital Facility”). Loans under the Bridge Facility and the Working Capital Facility had a maturity of no more than 12 months. The Bridge Facility incurred interest at a rate of 1.25% per annum over 3-month SAIBOR and the Working Capital Facility incurred interest at a rate of 1.70% per annum over 1~3-month SAIBOR and associated fees. 

On March 12, 2023, Lucid LLC entered into an amendment of the GIB Facility Agreement (together with the GIB Facility Agreement, the “Amended GIB Facility Agreement”) to combine the Bridge Facility and the Working Capital Facility into a committed SAR 1 billion (approximately $266.7 million) revolving credit facility (the “GIB Credit Facility”) which may be used for general corporate purposes. Loans under the Amended GIB Credit Facility Agreement have a maturity of no more than 12 months and bear interest at a rate of 1.40% per annum over SAIBOR (based on the term of borrowing) and associated fees.

We are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee of 0.15% per annum based on the unutilized portion of the GIB Credit Facility. Commitments under the Amended GIB Facility Agreement will terminate, and all amounts then outstanding thereunder would become payable, on the maturity date of the Amended GIB Facility Agreement. The Amended GIB Facility Agreement contains certain conditions precedent to drawdowns, representations and warranties and covenants of Lucid LLC and events of default.

As of December 31, 2023, we had outstanding borrowings of SAR 272 million (approximately $72.5 million) with weighted average interest rate of 7.49%. As of December 31, 2023, availability under the GIB Credit Facility was SAR 727 million (approximately $193.9 million), after giving effect to the outstanding letters of credit. As of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding borrowings of SAR 36 million (approximately $9.6 million) with interest rate of 6.40% from the Working Capital Facility. As of December 31, 2022, available borrowings were SAR 650 million (approximately $173.0 million) and SAR 314 million (approximately $83.5 million) under the Bridge Facility and Working Capital Facility, respectively. The outstanding borrowings were recorded within other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we were in compliance with applicable covenants under the Amended GIB Facility Agreement.

ABL Credit Facility

In June 2022, we entered into the ABL Credit Facility with a syndicate of banks that may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The ABL Credit Facility provides for an initial aggregate principal commitment amount of up to $1.0 billion (including a $350.0 million letter of credit subfacility and a $100.0 million swingline loan subfacility) and has a stated maturity date of June 9, 2027. Borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility bear interest at the applicable interest rates specified in the credit agreement governing the ABL Credit Facility. Availability under the ABL Credit Facility is subject to the value of eligible assets in the borrowing base and is reduced by outstanding loan borrowings and issuances of letters of credit which bear customary letter of credit fees. Subject to certain terms and conditions, we may request one or more increases in the amount of credit commitments under the ABL Credit Facility in an aggregate amount up to the sum of $500.0 million plus certain other amounts. We are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee of 0.25% per annum based on the unutilized portion of the ABL Credit Facility. 

The ABL Credit Facility contains customary covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to, among other activities, pay dividends, incur debt, create liens and encumbrances, redeem or repurchase stock, dispose of certain assets, consummate acquisitions or other investments, prepay certain debt, engage in transactions with affiliates, engage in sale and leaseback transactions or consummate mergers and other fundamental changes. The ABL Credit Facility also includes a minimum liquidity covenant which, at our option following satisfaction of certain pre-conditions, may be replaced with a springing, minimum fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenant, in each case on terms set forth in the credit agreement governing the ABL Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we were in compliance with applicable covenants under the ABL Credit Facility.

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility. Outstanding letters of credit under the ABL Credit Facility were $45.4 million and $37.4 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Availability under the ABL Credit Facility was $413.4 million (including $144.0 million cash and cash equivalents) and $441.4 million (including $37.3 million cash and cash equivalents) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, after giving effect to the borrowing base and the outstanding letters of credit. 

At-the-Market Offering, Subscription Agreements and Underwriting Agreement

In December 2022, we completed our at-the-market offering program (the “At-the-Market Offering”) pursuant to the equity distribution agreement for net proceeds of $594.3 million after deducting commissions and other issuance costs and also consummated a private placement of shares to Ayar (the “Subscription Agreement”) pursuant to the Subscription Agreement for $915.0 million. 

82

In June 2023, we completed the public offering pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement for aggregate net proceeds of $1.2 billion and also consummated a private placement of shares to Ayar pursuant to the 2023 Subscription Agreement for aggregate net proceeds of $1.8 billion after deducting issuance costs. See Note 12 “Stockholders’ Equity” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information.

We have generated significant losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $10.2 billion and $7.4 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Additionally, we have generated significant negative cash flows from operations and investing activities as we continue to support the growth of our business. 

The expenditures associated with the development and commercial launch of our vehicles, the anticipated increase in manufacturing capacity, and the international expansion of our business operations are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which may affect the timing and magnitude of these anticipated expenditures. These risk and uncertainties are described in more detail in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report. 

Cash Flows

The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):

Year Ended December 31,

20232022

Cash used in operating activities$(2,489,753)$(2,226,258)

Cash used in investing activities(946,975)(3,681,677)

Cash provided by financing activities

3,070,915 1,347,235 

Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash$(365,813)$(4,560,700)

Cash Used in Operating Activities

Our cash flows used in operating activities to date have been primarily comprised of cash outlays to support overall growth of the business, especially the costs related to inventory and sale of our vehicles, costs related to research and development, payroll and other general and administrative activities. As we continue to ramp up hiring after starting commercial operations, we expect our cash used in operating activities to increase significantly before it starts to generate any material cash flows from our business. 

Net cash used in operating activities increased by $263.5 million to $2,489.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to the increase in net loss excluding non-cash expenses and gains of $195.9 million and an overall increase in net operating assets and liabilities of $67.6 million. The change in net operating assets and liabilities was mainly attributable to advances to suppliers and timing of payments.

Cash Used in Investing Activities 

Our cash flows used in investing activities primarily relate to purchases of investments and capital expenditures to support our growth. We continue to experience negative cash flows from investing activities as we expand our business and continue to build our infrastructure. 

Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $2,734.7 million to $947.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in proceeds from maturities and sales of investments of $2,719.6 million, partially offset by an increase in purchases of investments of $144.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year.

Cash Provided by Financing Activities

Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily from the issuances of equity securities, including the At-the-Market Offering, the private placements to Ayar, convertible preferred stock, the proceeds of the Merger, and the 2026 Notes.

Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $1,723.7 million to $3,070.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily attributable to higher net proceeds of $1.5 billion from our equity offerings in 2023.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures in our financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates and any such differences may be material.

We believe that the following accounting policies involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of our operations. For more information about our accounting policies, see Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Revenue Recognition

We follow a five-step process in which we identify the contract, identify the related performance obligations, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the identified performance obligations, and recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligations are satisfied. 

Vehicle Sales

Vehicle Sales without Residual Value Guarantee

Vehicle sales revenue is generated from the sale of electric vehicles to customers. There are two performance obligations identified in vehicle sale arrangements. These are the vehicle including an onboard advanced driver assistance system (“ADAS”), and the right to unspecified over-the-air (“OTA”) software updates to be provided as and when available over the term of the basic vehicle warranty, which is generally 4 years. Shipping and handling provided by Company is considered a fulfillment activity.

Payment is typically received at or prior to the transfer of control of the vehicle to the customer, except for vehicle sales under the EV Purchase Agreement. Generally, control transfers to the customer at the time of delivery when the customer takes physical possession of the vehicle, which may be at a Lucid studio or other destination chosen by the customer. Our vehicle contracts do not contain a significant financing component. We have elected to exclude sales taxes from the measurement of the transaction price. We estimate the standalone selling price of all performance obligations by considering costs used to develop and deliver the good or service, third-party pricing of similar goods or services and other information that may be available. The transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations in proportion to the standalone selling price of our performance obligations. 

We recognize revenue related to the vehicle when the customer obtains control of the vehicle which occurs at a point in time either upon completion of delivery to the agreed upon delivery location or upon pick up of the vehicle by the customer. As the unspecified OTA software updates are provided when-and-if they become available, revenue related to OTA software updates is recognized ratably over the basic vehicle warranty term, commencing when control of the vehicle is transferred to the customer.

At the time of revenue recognition, we reduce the transaction price and record a sales return reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product returns. Such return rate estimates are based on historical experience.

We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all vehicles sold. The warranty covers the rectification of reported defects via repair, replacement, or adjustment of faulty parts or components. The warranty does not cover any item where failure is due to normal wear and tear. This assurance-type warranty does not create a performance obligation separate from the vehicle. The estimated cost of the assurance-type warranty is accrued at the time of vehicle sale.

84

Vehicle Sales with Residual Value Guarantee

We provide a residual value guarantee (“RVG”) to our commercial banking partner in connection with its vehicle leasing program. Under the vehicle leasing program, we generally receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery or shortly after delivery, do not bear casualty and credit risks during the lease term, and are contractually obligated (or entitled) to share a portion of the shortfall (or excess) between the resale value realized by the commercial banking partner and a predetermined resale value. At the lease inception, we are required to deposit cash collateral equal to a contractual percentage of the residual value of the leased vehicles with the commercial banking partner. The cash collateral is held in a restricted bank account owned by the commercial banking partner until it is used, as applicable, in settlement of the RVG at the end of the lease term. Cash collateral is recorded in other noncurrent assets, subject to asset impairment review at each reporting period. 

We account for the vehicle leasing program in accordance with ASC 842, Leases, ASC 460, Guarantees and ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We are the lessor at inception of a lease and immediately transfer the lease as well as the underlying vehicle to our commercial banking partner, with the transaction being accounted for as a sale under ASC 606. We recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery when the consumer-lessee takes physical possession of the vehicle, and bifurcate the RVG at fair value and account for it as a guarantee liability. The remaining amount of the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations, including the vehicle, the right to unspecified OTA software updates and remarketing activities, in proportion to the standalone selling price of our performance obligations. 

The guarantee liability represents the estimated amount we expect to pay at the end of the lease term. We are released from residual risk upon either expiration or settlement of the RVG. We evaluate variables such as third-party residual value publications, risk of future price deterioration due to changes in market conditions and reconditioning costs to determine the estimated residual value guarantee liability. As we accumulate more data related to the resale value of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there could be material changes to the estimated guarantee liabilities.

Inventory Valuation

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of future demand forecast and market conditions, the excess amounts are written-off. 

Inventory is also reviewed to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.

In the event there are changes in our estimates of future selling prices or production costs, we might be required to record additional and potentially material write-downs. A small change in our estimates may result in a material change in our reported financial results.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information.

Item 7A. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity price and inflationary pressure. 

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates applicable to our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments. We had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments totaling $4.32 billion as of December 31, 2023. Our investment policy is focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity needs. Under the policy, we invest in highly rated securities, primarily issued by the U.S. government or liquid money market funds. We do not invest in financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We utilize external investment managers who adhere to the guidelines of our investment policy. Based on investment positions as of December 31, 2023, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in $13.4 million incremental decline in the fair market value of our portfolio.

85

Equity Price Risk 

We hold equity securities of Aston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings plc (together with its subsidiaries, “Aston Martin”). The fair value of these equity securities was $81.5 million as of December 31, 2023. Changes in fair value of these equity securities are impacted by the volatility of the stock market and changes in general economic conditions, among other factors. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the stock price of these equity securities would decrease the fair value as of December 31, 2023 by $8.2 million.

Inflationary Pressure

The U.S. and Saudi Arabia economies have experienced increased inflation, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our cost to manufacture a vehicle is heavily influenced by the cost of the key components and materials used in the vehicle, cost of labor, as well as cost of equipment used in our manufacturing facilities. As we continue our phased construction of our AMP-1 and AMP-2 facilities, any further increases in material and infrastructure equipment prices and cost of construction labor could lead to higher capital expenditures.

Supply Risk

We are dependent on our suppliers, the majority of which are single-source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of its products according to the schedule and at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or its inability to efficiently manage these components, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
