Item 1A.  Risk Factors

The discussion below addresses our material risk factors of which we are aware. Any risk factor, either by itself or together with other risk factors, could materially and adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition. References to third parties may include suppliers, service providers, counterparties, financial market utilities, exchanges and clearing houses, data aggregators and other partners and their upstream and downstream service providers (e.g., fourth parties, fifth parties) who may also contribute to our risks. Other factors not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial could also adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition. Therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered all of the potential risks that we may face. For more information on how we manage risks, see Managing Risk in the MD&A beginning on page 44. For more information about the risks contained in this section, see Item 1. Business beginning on page 2, MD&A beginning on page 25 and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 94.

Market 

We may be adversely affected by the financial markets, fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policies, and economic conditions.

General economic, political, social and health conditions in the U.S. and abroad affect financial markets and our business. In particular, global markets may be affected by the level and volatility of interest rates, availability and market conditions of financing, changes in gross domestic product (GDP), economic growth or its sustainability, inflation, supply chain disruptions, consumer spending, employment levels, labor shortages, challenging labor market conditions, wage stagnation, federal government shutdowns, energy prices, home prices, commercial property values, bankruptcies and a default by a significant market participant or class of counterparties, including companies in emerging markets. Global markets also may be affected by adverse developments impacting the U.S. or global banking industry, including bank failures and liquidity concerns, fluctuations or other significant changes in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies, the transition of benchmark rates, including the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY), to alternative reference rates (ARRs), the impact of the volatility of digital assets on the broader market, the rate of growth of global trade and commerce, trade policies, the availability and cost of capital and credit, disruption of communication, transportation or energy infrastructure, recessionary fears, investor sentiment and the U.S. and global election cycles, including resulting changes to policy and the geopolitical environment. Global markets, including energy and commodity markets, may also be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of climate change, acute and/or chronic extreme weather events or natural disasters, the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, cyberattacks, military conflict, terrorism, or other geopolitical events. Market fluctuations may impact our margin requirements and affect our liquidity. Any sudden or prolonged market downturn, as a result of the above factors or otherwise, could result in a decline in net interest income and noninterest income and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including capital and liquidity levels. Elevated inflation and interest rate levels, monetary tightening by central banks, and geopolitical developments, including the Russia/Ukraine conflict and the conflict in the Middle East, have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact 

financial markets and macroeconomic conditions and could result in additional market volatility and disruptions.

Global uncertainties regarding fiscal and monetary policies present economic challenges. Actions taken by the Federal Reserve or central banks in other jurisdictions, including changes in target rates, balance sheet management and lending facilities, are beyond our control and difficult to predict, particularly in an elevated inflation environment. This can affect interest rates and the value of financial instruments and other assets, such as debt securities, and impact our borrowers and potentially increase delinquency rates and may also raise government debt levels, adversely affect businesses and household incomes, adversely impact the banking sector generally, and increase uncertainty surrounding monetary policy. Monetary policy in response to high inflation has led to a significant increase in market interest rates and a flattening and/or inversion of the yield curve. This has resulted in and may continue to result in volatility of equity and other markets, further volatility of the U.S. dollar, a widening in credit spreads and higher interest rates and recessionary concerns, and could result in elevated unemployment, which could impact investor risk appetite and our borrowers, potentially increasing delinquency rates. Financial market volatility could also result from uncertainty about the timing and extent of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in response to moderating inflation and/or weakening economic conditions. Elevated inflation may limit the scope of monetary support, including cuts to the federal funds rate, in the event of an economic downturn, resulting in a more protracted period of a flat and/or inverted yield curve.

Any future change in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, in an effort to stimulate the economy or otherwise, resulting in lower interest rates would likely result in lower revenue through lower net interest income, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, changes to existing U.S. laws and regulatory policies and evolving priorities, including those related to financial regulation, taxation, international trade, fiscal policy, climate change (including efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy) and healthcare, may adversely impact U.S. or global economic activity and our customers', our counterparties' and our earnings and operations. Globally, many central banks have simultaneously reduced monetary accommodation through interest rate or balance sheet policy, which has contributed and may continue to contribute to elevated financial and capital market volatility and significant changes to asset values. While higher interest rates have positively impacted our net interest income, higher interest rates have negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact investment securities, deposits, loan demand and funding costs. In addition to higher interest rates, wider credit spreads can negatively impact capital by reducing the value of debt securities. High and rising federal debt levels and uncertainty about the U.S. budget process could lead to higher interest rates and financial market volatility, potentially impacting broader economic activity. Further, if the U.S. government’s debt ceiling limit is not raised in January 2025, the ramifications could result in market volatility, ratings downgrades and limit fiscal policy responses to recessionary conditions. This could have a negative and potentially severe impact on the U.S. and world economy and financial and capital markets, including higher interest rates, higher volatility, lower asset values, lower liquidity, downgrades to U.S. debt, and a weakened U.S. dollar.

Changes to international trade and investment policies by the U.S. could negatively impact financial markets. Escalation of tensions between the U.S. and the People’s Republic of China 

Bank of America  8

(China) could lead to further U.S. measures that adversely affect financial markets, disrupt world trade and commerce and lead to trade retaliation, including through the use of tariffs, foreign exchange measures or the large-scale sale of U.S. Treasury bonds. Any restrictions on the activities of businesses, could also negatively affect financial markets.

These developments could adversely affect our businesses, customers, securities and derivatives portfolios, including the risk of lower re-investment rates within those portfolios, our level of charge-offs and provision for credit losses, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets, our capital levels, our liquidity and our results of operations.

Increased market volatility and adverse changes in financial or capital market conditions may increase our market risk.

Our liquidity, competitive position, business, results of operations and financial condition are affected by market risks such as changes in interest and currency exchange rates, fluctuations in equity, commodity and futures prices, trading volumes and prices of securitized products, the implied volatility of interest rates and credit spreads and other economic and business factors. These market risks may adversely affect, among other things, the value of our securities, including our on- and off-balance sheet securities, trading assets and other financial instruments, the cost of debt capital and our access to credit markets, the value of assets under management (AUM), fee income relating to AUM, customer allocation of capital among investment alternatives, the volume of client activity in our trading operations, investment banking, underwriting and other capital market fees, which have already been negatively impacted, the general profitability and risk level of the transactions in which we engage and our competitiveness with respect to deposit pricing. The value of certain of our assets is sensitive to changes in market interest rates. If the Federal Reserve or a non-U.S. central bank changes or signals a change in monetary policy, market interest rates or credit spreads could be affected, which could adversely impact the value of such assets. Changes to fiscal policy, including expansion of U.S. federal deficit spending and resultant debt issuance, could also affect market interest rates. If interest rates decrease, our results of operations could be negatively impacted, including future revenue and earnings growth.

Our models and strategies to assess and control our market risk exposures are subject to inherent limitations. In times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated. Such changes to the relationship between market parameters may limit the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and cause us to incur significant losses. Changes in correlation can be exacerbated where market participants use risk or trading models with assumptions or algorithms similar to ours. In these and other cases, it may be difficult to reduce our risk positions due to activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations, including circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or no market exists. Where we own securities that do not have an established liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or hedging, or where the degree of accessible liquidity declines significantly, we may not be able to reduce our positions and risks associated with such holdings, so we may suffer larger than expected losses when adverse price movements take place. This risk can be exacerbated where we hold a position that is large relative to the available liquidity.

If asset values decline, we may incur losses and negative impacts to capital and liquidity requirements.

We have a large portfolio of financial instruments, including loans and loan commitments, securities financing agreements, asset-backed secured financings, derivative assets and liabilities, debt securities, marketable equity securities and certain other assets and liabilities that we measure at fair value and are subject to valuation and impairment assessments. We determine these values based on applicable accounting guidance, which, for financial instruments measured at fair value, requires an entity to base fair value on exit price and to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in fair value measurements. The fair values of these financial instruments include adjustments for market liquidity, credit quality, funding impact on certain derivatives and other transaction-specific factors, where appropriate.

Gains or losses on these instruments can have a direct impact on our results of operations, unless we have effectively mitigated the risk of our exposures. Increases in interest rates may cause decreases in residential mortgage loan originations and could impact the origination of corporate debt. In addition, increases in interest rates or changes in spreads may continue to adversely impact the fair value of our debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as available-for-sale (AFS), adversely affect accumulated other comprehensive income and, thus, our capital levels. Increases in interest rates could also adversely impact our regulatory liquidity position and requirements, which include certain AFS debt securities and the use of repurchase agreements against a portion of the held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities. As our liquidity is dependent on the fair value of these assets, increases in market interest rates, which have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact the fair value of debt securities, could adversely affect liquidity levels.

Fair values may be impacted by declining values of the underlying assets or the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the continued availability of these transactions or indices. The financial strength of counterparties, with whom we have economically hedged some of our exposure to these assets, also will affect the fair value of these assets. Sudden declines and volatility in the prices of assets may curtail or eliminate trading activities in these assets, which may make it difficult to sell, hedge or value these assets. The inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions, and the difficulty in valuing assets may increase our risk-weighted assets (RWA), which requires us to maintain additional capital and increases our funding costs. Values of AUM also impact revenues in our wealth management and related advisory businesses for asset-based management and performance fees. Declines in values of AUM can result in lower fees earned for managing such assets.

Liquidity

If we are unable to access the capital markets, have prolonged net deposits outflows, or our borrowing costs increase, our liquidity and competitive position will be negatively affected.

Liquidity is essential to our businesses. We fund our assets primarily with globally sourced deposits in our bank entities, as well as secured and unsecured liabilities transacted in the capital markets. We rely on certain secured funding sources, such as repo markets, which are typically short-term and credit-sensitive. We also engage in asset securitization transactions, including with the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), to fund consumer lending activities. Our liquidity could be adversely affected by any inability to access the capital markets, illiquidity or volatility in the capital markets, the decrease in value of eligible collateral or increased collateral requirements (including as a result of credit concerns for short-term 

9  Bank of America

borrowing), changes to our relationships with our funding providers based on real or perceived changes in our risk profile, prolonged federal government shutdowns, or changes in regulations, guidance or GSE status that impact our funding.

Additionally, our liquidity or cost of funds may be negatively impacted by the unwillingness or inability of the Federal Reserve to act as lender of last resort, unexpected simultaneous draws on lines of credit or deposits, slower customer payment rates, restricted access to the assets of prime brokerage clients, the withdrawal of or failure to attract customer deposits or invested funds (which could result from attrition driven by customers seeking higher yielding deposits or securities products, customer desire to utilize an alternative financial institution perceived to be safer, changes in customer spending behavior due to inflation, decline in the economy or other drivers resulting in an increased need for cash), increased regulatory liquidity, capital and margin requirements for our U.S. or international banks and their nonbank subsidiaries, which could result in the inability to transfer liquidity internally and inefficient funding, changes in patterns of intraday liquidity usage resulting from a counterparty or technology failure or other idiosyncratic event or failure or default by a significant market participant or third party (including clearing agents, custodians, central banks or central counterparty clearinghouses (CCPs)). These factors may increase our borrowing costs and negatively impact our liquidity.

Several of these factors may arise due to circumstances beyond our control, such as general market volatility, disruption, shock or stress, the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, and military conflicts (including the Russia/Ukraine conflict and the conflict in the Middle East). Federal Reserve policy decisions (including fluctuations in interest rates or Federal Reserve balance sheet composition), negative views or loss of confidence about us or the financial services industry generally or due to a specific news event, changes in the regulatory environment or governmental fiscal or monetary policies, actions by credit rating agencies or an operational problem that affects third parties or us. The impact of these potentially sudden events, whether within our control or not, could include an inability to sell assets or redeem investments, unforeseen outflows of cash, the need to draw on liquidity facilities, the reduction of financing balances and the loss of equity secured funding, debt repurchases to support the secondary market or meet client requests, the need for additional funding for commitments and contingencies and unexpected collateral calls, among other things, the result of which could be increased costs, a liquidity shortfall and/or impact on our liquidity coverage ratio.

Our liquidity and cost of obtaining funding may be directly related to investor behavior and confidence, debt market disruption, firm specific concerns or prevailing market conditions, including changes in interest and currency exchange rates, significant fluctuations in equity and futures prices, lower trading volumes and prices of securitized products and our credit spreads. Increases in interest rates and our credit spreads can increase the cost of our funding and result in mark-to-market or credit valuation adjustment exposures. Changes in our credit spreads are market driven and may be influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness, including changes in our credit ratings or changes in broader financial market and macroeconomic conditions. Changes to interest rates and our credit spreads occur continuously and may be unpredictable and highly volatile. We may also experience net interest margin compression as a result of offering higher than expected deposit rates in order to attract and maintain deposits. Concentrations within our funding profile, such as maturities, 

currencies or counterparties, can also reduce our funding efficiency.

Reduction in our credit ratings could limit our access to funding or the capital markets, increase borrowing costs or trigger additional collateral or funding requirements.

Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly impacted by our credit ratings. Credit ratings are also important to investors, customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and seek to engage in certain transactions, including over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by rating agencies, which consider a number of financial and nonfinancial factors, including our franchise, financial strength, performance and prospects, management, governance, risk management practices, capital adequacy, asset quality and operations, among other criteria, as well as factors not under our control, such as regulatory developments, the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment and changes to the methodologies used to determine our ratings.

Rating agencies could adjust our credit ratings at any time and there can be no assurance as to whether or when a downgrade could occur. Any reduction could result in a wider credit spread and negatively affect our access to credit markets, the related cost of funds, our businesses and certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where counterparty creditworthiness is critical. If the short-term credit ratings of our parent company, bank or broker-dealer subsidiaries were downgraded, we may experience loss of access to short-term funding sources such as repo financing, and/or incur increased cost of funds and increased collateral requirements. Under the terms of certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, if our or our subsidiaries’ credit ratings are downgraded, the counterparties may require additional collateral or terminate these contracts or agreements.

While certain potential impacts are contractual and quantifiable, the full consequences of a credit rating downgrade are inherently uncertain and depend upon numerous dynamic, complex and inter-related factors and assumptions, including the relationship between long-term and short-term credit ratings and the behaviors of customers, investors and counterparties.

Bank of America Corporation is a holding company, is dependent on its subsidiaries for liquidity and may be restricted from transferring funds from subsidiaries.

Bank of America Corporation, as the parent company, is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries. We evaluate and manage liquidity on a legal entity basis. Legal entity liquidity is an important consideration as there are legal, regulatory, contractual and other limitations on our ability to utilize liquidity from one legal entity to satisfy the liquidity requirements of another, including the parent company, which could result in adverse liquidity events. The parent company depends on dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries to fund dividend payments on our preferred stock and common stock and to fund all payments on our other obligations, including debt obligations. Any inability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds, pay dividends or make payments to us may adversely affect our cash flow, liquidity and financial condition.

Many of our subsidiaries, including our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments, or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries. Our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates, minimum regulatory capital and liquidity requirements 

Bank of America  10

and restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in bank or brokerage accounts to fund their businesses. Intercompany arrangements we entered into in connection with our resolution planning submissions could restrict the amount of funding available to the parent company from our subsidiaries under certain adverse conditions.

Additional restrictions on related party transactions, increased capital and liquidity requirements and additional limitations on the use of funds on deposit in bank or brokerage accounts, as well as lower earnings, can reduce the amount of funds available to meet the obligations of the parent company and even require the parent company to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries. Also, regulatory action that requires additional liquidity at each of our subsidiaries could impede access to funds we need to pay our obligations or pay dividends. In addition, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors.

Bank of America Corporation’s liquidity and financial condition, and the ability to pay dividends and obligations, could be adversely affected in the event of a resolution.

Bank of America Corporation, our parent holding company, is required to periodically submit a plan to the FDIC and Federal Reserve describing its resolution strategy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of material financial distress or failure. Bank of America Corporation’s preferred resolution strategy is a “single point of entry” strategy, whereby only the parent holding company would file for bankruptcy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Certain key operating subsidiaries would be provided with sufficient capital and liquidity to operate through severe stress and to enable such subsidiaries to continue operating or be wound down in a solvent manner following a bankruptcy of the parent holding company. Bank of America Corporation has entered into intercompany arrangements resulting in the contribution of most of its capital and liquidity to key subsidiaries. Pursuant to these arrangements, if Bank of America Corporation’s liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution becomes imminent, it will no longer be able to draw liquidity from its key subsidiaries and will be required to contribute its remaining financial assets to a wholly-owned holding company subsidiary. This could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including the ability to meet our payment obligations and the ability to return capital to shareholders, including through the payment of dividends and repurchase of the Corporation’s common stock.

If the FDIC and Federal Reserve jointly determine that Bank of America Corporation’s resolution plan is not credible, they could impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities or operations. We could also be required to take certain actions that could impose operating costs and result in the divestiture of assets or restructuring of businesses and subsidiaries.

When a G-SIB such as Bank of America Corporation is in default or danger of default, the FDIC may be appointed receiver to conduct an orderly liquidation, and could, among other things, invoke the orderly liquidation authority, instead of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, if the Secretary of the Treasury makes certain financial distress and systemic risk determinations. Additionally, the FDIC could replace Bank of America Corporation with a bridge holding company, which could continue operations and result in an orderly resolution of the underlying bank, but whose equity would be held solely for the benefit of our creditors. The FDIC’s “single point of entry” strategy may result in our security holders suffering greater losses than would have been the case under a bankruptcy proceeding or a different resolution strategy.

If the Corporation is resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or the FDIC’s orderly liquidation authority, third-party creditors of our subsidiaries may receive significant or full recoveries on their claims, while security holders of Bank of America Corporation could face significant or complete losses.

Credit

Economic or market disruptions and insufficient credit loss reserves may result in a higher provision for credit losses.

A number of our products expose us to credit risk, including loans, letters of credit, derivatives, debt securities, trading account assets and assets held-for-sale. Deterioration in the financial condition of our consumer and commercial borrowers, counterparties or underlying collateral could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Our credit portfolios may be impacted by U.S. and global macroeconomic and market conditions, events and disruptions, including declines in GDP, consumer spending or property values, asset price corrections, increasing consumer and corporate leverage, increases in corporate bond spreads, government shutdowns or policies such as student loan debt payment resumptions, tax changes, rising or elevated unemployment levels, elevated inflation, fluctuations in foreign exchange or interest rates, as well as the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, extreme weather events and the impacts of climate change, including acute and/or chronic extreme weather events and efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy. Significant economic or market stresses and disruptions typically have a negative impact on the business environment and financial markets, which could impact the underlying credit quality of our borrowers, counterparties and assets. Property value declines or asset price corrections could increase the risk of borrowers or counterparties defaulting or becoming delinquent in their obligations to us, and could decrease the value of the collateral we hold, which could increase credit losses. Credit risk could also be magnified by lending to leveraged borrowers or declining asset prices, including property or collateral values, unrelated to macroeconomic stress. Simultaneous drawdowns on lines of credit and/or an increase in a borrower’s leverage in a weakening economic environment, or otherwise, could result in deterioration in our credit portfolio, should borrowers be unable to fulfill competing financial obligations. Increased delinquency and default rates could adversely affect our credit portfolios, including consumer credit card, home equity and residential mortgage portfolios through increased charge-offs and provisions for credit losses.

A recessionary environment and/or a rise in unemployment could adversely impact the ability of our consumer and/or commercial borrowers or counterparties to meet their financial obligations and negatively impact our credit portfolio. Consumers have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by inflation, resulting in drawdowns of savings or increases in household debt. Higher interest rates, which have increased debt servicing costs for some businesses and households, may adversely impact credit quality, particularly in a recessionary environment. Certain sectors also remain at risk (e.g., commercial real estate, particularly office) as a result of shifts in demand and tighter financial and credit conditions. Globally, conditions of slow growth or recession could further contribute to weaker credit conditions. If the macroeconomic environment or certain sectors worsen, our credit portfolio, net charge-offs, provision and allowance for credit losses could be adversely impacted. 

11  Bank of America

We establish an allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, based on management's best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses (ECL) inherent in our relevant financial assets. The process to determine the allowance for credit losses uses models and assumptions that require us to make difficult and complex judgments that are often interrelated, including forecasting how borrowers or counterparties may perform in changing economic conditions. The ability of our borrowers or counterparties to repay their obligations may be impacted by changes in future economic conditions, which in turn could impact the accuracy of our loss forecasts and allowance estimates. There is also the possibility that we have failed or will fail to accurately identify the appropriate economic indicators or accurately estimate their impacts to our borrowers or counterparties, which could impact the accuracy of our loss forecasts and allowance estimates.

If the models, estimates and assumptions we use to establish reserves or the judgments we make in extending credit to our borrowers or counterparties, which are more sensitive due to the current uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, prove inaccurate in predicting future events, we may suffer losses in excess of our ECL. In addition, changes to external factors can negatively impact our recognition of credit losses in our portfolios and allowance for credit losses.

The allowance for credit losses is our best estimate of ECL; however, there is no guarantee that it will be sufficient to address credit losses, particularly if the economic outlook deteriorates significantly, quickly, or unexpectedly. As circumstances change, we may increase our allowance, which would reduce our earnings. If economic conditions worsen, impacting our consumer and commercial borrowers, counterparties or underlying collateral, and credit losses are worse than expected, we may increase our provision for credit losses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Our concentrations of credit risk could adversely affect our credit losses, results of operations and financial condition.

We may be subject to concentrations of credit risk because of a common characteristic or common sensitivity to economic, financial, public health or business developments. Concentrations of credit risk may reside in a particular industry, geography, product, asset class, counterparty or within any pool of exposures with a common risk characteristic. A deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry, geographic location, product or asset class, or a failure or downgrade of, or default by, any particular entity or group of entities could negatively affect our businesses, and it is possible our limits and credit monitoring exposure controls will not function as anticipated.

We execute a high volume of transactions and have significant credit concentrations with respect to the financial services industry, predominantly comprised of broker-dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, CCPs and other institutional clients. Financial services institutions and other counterparties are inter-related because of trading, funding, clearing or other relationships. Defaults by one or more counterparties, or market uncertainty about the financial stability of one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to market-wide liquidity disruptions, losses, defaults and related disputes and litigation.

Our credit risk may also be heightened by market risk when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or 

derivatives exposure due to us, which may occur as a result of events that impact the value of the collateral, such as a sudden change in asset price or fraud. Disputes with obligors as to the valuation of collateral could increase in times of significant market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and we could suffer losses during such periods if we are unable to realize the fair value of the collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral.

We have concentrations of credit risk, including with respect to our consumer real estate and consumer credit card exposure, as well as our commercial real estate and asset managers and funds portfolios, which represent a significant percentage of our overall credit portfolio. Declining home price valuations and demand where we have large concentrations could result in increased servicing advances and expenses, defaults, delinquencies or credit losses. The impacts of earthquakes, as well as climate change, such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels, and the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters, including droughts, floods, wildfires and hurricanes, could negatively impact collateral, the valuations of home or commercial real estate or our customers’ ability and/or willingness to pay fees, outstanding loans or afford new products. This could also cause insurability risk and/or increased insurance costs to customers.

Economic weaknesses, sustained elevated inflation, adverse business conditions, market disruptions, adverse economic or market events, rising interest or capitalization rates, declining asset prices, greater volatility in areas where we have concentrated credit risk or deterioration in real estate values or household incomes may cause us to experience higher credit losses in our portfolios or write down the value of certain assets. We could also experience continued and long-term negative impacts to our commercial credit exposure and an increase in credit losses within those industries that may be permanently impacted by a change in consumer preferences or other industry disruptions.

We also enter into transactions with sovereign nations, U.S. states and municipalities. Unfavorable economic or political conditions, disruptions to capital markets, currency fluctuations, changes in oil prices, social instability and changes in government or monetary policies could adversely impact the operating budgets or credit ratings of these government entities and expose us to credit and liquidity risk.

Liquidity disruptions in the financial markets may result in our inability to sell, syndicate or realize the value of our positions, increasing concentrations, which could increase RWA and the credit and market risk associated with our positions.

We may be adversely affected by weaknesses in the U.S. housing market.

During 2023, the U.S. housing market continued to be impacted by higher mortgage rates, including 30-year fixed-rate mortgages that more than doubled from 2021. This has negatively impacted the demand in some cases and underlying collateral for many of our products. Additionally, our mortgage loan production volume is generally influenced by the rate of growth in residential mortgage debt outstanding and the size of the residential mortgage market, both of which have slowed due to higher interest rates and reduced affordability. A deeper downturn in the condition of the U.S. housing market could result in significant write-downs of asset values in several asset classes, notably mortgage-backed securities (MBS). If the U.S. housing market were to further weaken, the value of real estate could decline, which could result in increased credit losses and delinquent servicing expenses, negatively affect our 

Bank of America  12

representations and warranties exposures, and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Our derivatives businesses may expose us to unexpected risks, which may result in losses and adversely affect liquidity.

We are party to a large number of derivatives transactions that may expose us to unexpected market, credit and operational risks that could cause us to suffer unexpected losses. Fluctuations in asset values or rates or an unanticipated credit event, including unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated, may lead to losses resulting from risks not taken into account or anticipated in the development, structuring or pricing of a derivative instrument. Certain derivative contracts and other trading agreements provide that upon the occurrence of certain specified events, such as a change to our or our affiliates’ credit ratings, we may be required to provide additional collateral or take other remedial actions, and we could experience increased difficulty obtaining funding or hedging risks. In some cases our counterparties may have the right to terminate or otherwise diminish our rights under these contracts or agreements upon the occurrence of such events.

We are also a member of various CCPs, which results in credit risk exposure to those CCPs. In the event that one or more members of a CCP default on their obligations, we may be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the CCP as a result of that default. A CCP may also, at its discretion, modify the margin we are required to post, which could mean unexpected and increased funding costs and exposure to that CCP. As a clearing member, we are exposed to the risk of non-performance by our clients for which we clear transactions, which may not be covered by available collateral. Additionally, default by a significant market participant may result in further risk and potential losses.

Geopolitical

We are subject to numerous political, economic, market, reputational, operational, compliance, legal, regulatory and other risks in the jurisdictions in which we operate.

We do business throughout the world, including in emerging markets. Economic or geopolitical stress in one or more countries could have a negative impact regionally or globally, resulting in, among other things, market volatility, reduced market value and economic output. Our liquidity and credit risk could be adversely impacted by, and our businesses and revenues derived from non-U.S. jurisdictions are subject to, risk of loss from financial, social or judicial instability, economic sanctions, changes in government leadership, including as a result of electoral outcomes or otherwise, changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks, expropriation, nationalization and/or confiscation of assets, price controls, high inflation, natural disasters, the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, capital controls, currency re-denomination risk from a country exiting the EU or otherwise, currency fluctuations, foreign exchange controls or movements (caused by devaluation or de-pegging), unfavorable political and diplomatic developments, oil price fluctuations and changes in legislation. These risks are especially elevated in emerging markets.

Continued tensions between the U.S. and important trading partners, particularly China, may result in sanctions, further tariff increases or other restrictive actions on cross-border trade, investment and transfer of information technology, which could reduce trade volumes, result in further supply chain disruptions, increase costs for producers, and adversely affect our 

businesses and revenues, as well as our customers and counterparties, including their credit quality.

Slowing growth, recessionary conditions, adverse geopolitical conditions and/or political or civil unrest, labor shortages, wage pressures and elevated inflation in certain countries pose  challenges, including in the form of volatility in financial markets. Foreign exchange rates against the U.S. dollar remain an area of uncertainty and potential volatility, and depreciation could increase our financial risks with clients that deal in non-U.S. currencies but have U.S. dollar-denominated debt.

We invest or trade in the securities of corporations and governments located in non-U.S. jurisdictions, including emerging markets. Revenues from the trading of non-U.S. securities may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors. Furthermore, the impact of these fluctuations could be magnified because non-U.S. trading markets, particularly in emerging markets, are generally smaller, less liquid and more volatile than U.S. trading markets. Risks in one nation can limit our opportunities for portfolio growth and negatively affect our operations in other nations, including our U.S. operations. Market and economic disruptions may affect consumer confidence levels and spending, corporate investment and job creation, bankruptcy rates, levels of incurrence and default on consumer and corporate debt, economic growth rates and asset values, among other factors.

Elevated government debt levels raise the risk of volatility, significant valuation changes, political tensions among EU members regarding fiscal policy or defaults on or devaluation of sovereign debt, which could expose us to substantial losses. Financial markets have been and may continue to be sensitive to government plans to lower taxes or increase spending.

Our non-U.S. businesses are also subject to extensive regulation by governments, securities exchanges and regulators, central banks and other regulatory bodies. In many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services and securities industries are less predictable, prone to change and uncertainty, and regularly evolving. Significant resources are spent on determining, understanding and monitoring foreign laws, rules and regulations, as well as managing our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions. Our inability to remain in compliance with local laws and manage our relationships with regulators could result in increased expenses, changes to our organizational structure and adversely affect our businesses, reputation and results of operations in that market.

We are also subject to complex and extensive U.S. and non-U.S. laws, rules and regulations, which subject us to costs and risks relating to bribery and corruption, know-your-customer requirements, anti-money laundering, embargo programs and economic sanctions, which can vary by jurisdiction and require implementation of complex operational capabilities and compliance programs. Non-compliance, including improper implementation, and/or violations could result in an increase in operational and compliance costs, and enforcement actions and civil and criminal penalties against us and individual employees. The increasing speed and novel ways in which funds circulate could make it more challenging to track the movement of funds and heighten financial crimes risk. Compliance with these evolving regulatory regimes and legal requirements depends on our ability to improve our processes, controls, surveillance, detection and reporting and analytic capabilities.

In the U.S., the government’s debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns have increased the possibility of U.S. government defaults on its debt and/or further downgrades to its credit ratings, and prolonged government shutdowns, which could 

13  Bank of America

weaken the U.S. dollar, cause market volatility, negatively impact the global economy and banking system and adversely affect our financial condition, including our liquidity. Additionally, changes in fiscal, monetary, regulatory and/or foreign policy, including as a result of the election cycle, labor shortages, wage pressures, supply chain disruptions and higher inflation, could increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business operations, organizational structure and results of operations. Emerging market currency values and monetary policy settings are particularly sensitive to such changes in U.S. monetary policy. Additionally, further restrictive U.S. monetary policy, potentially including further rate increases, could result in additional currency volatility and recessionary conditions in a number of non-U.S. markets.

We are also subject to geopolitical risks, including economic sanctions, acts or threats of international or domestic terrorism, including responses by the U.S. or other governments thereto, increased state-sponsored cyberattacks or campaigns, civil unrest and/or military conflicts, including the escalation of tensions between China and Taiwan, which could adversely affect business, market trade and general economic conditions abroad and in the U.S. The Russia/Ukraine conflict and the conflict in the Middle East have magnified such risks and resulted in regional instability and adversely impacted commodity and other financial markets, as well as economic conditions, especially in Europe. Widening regional conflicts resulting in the involvement of neighboring countries and/or North Atlantic Treaty Organization member countries could result in additional economic disruptions, financial market volatility, higher inflation and changes to asset valuations, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations.

Business Operations

A failure in or breach of our operations or information systems, or those of third parties or the financial services industry, could cause disruptions, adversely impact our businesses, results of operations and financial condition, and cause legal or reputational harm.

Operational risk exposure exists throughout our organization and as a result of our extensive interactions with, and reliance on, third parties and the financial services industry, including the processing and reporting of a large number of transactions in many currencies and jurisdictions. Our operations and information systems, which comprise the hardware, software, infrastructure, backup systems and other technology which we own or use to collect, process, maintain, use, share, disseminate or dispose of information, are integral to the performance of our businesses.

Our operations and information systems and components thereof, and those of our third parties, have been, and in the future could be, ineffective or fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our or such third party’s control. Such events have adversely affected, and in the future could adversely affect, physical site access of our operations, our ability to process transactions, provide services and perform other operations. Short-term or prolonged disruptions to our critical business operations and customer services are possible due to computer, telecommunications, network, utility, electronic or physical infrastructure outages, including from abuse or failure of our electronic trading and algorithmic platforms, significant unplanned increases in customer transactions, fraudulent transactions, newly identified vulnerabilities in key hardware and software, failure of 

infrastructure or manual processes, technology project implementation challenges and supply chain disruptions. Operational disruptions and prolonged operational outages could also result from events arising from natural disasters, including acute and chronic weather events, such as wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes and floods, some of which are happening with more frequency and severity, and earthquakes, as well as local or larger scale political or social matters, including civil unrest, terrorist acts and military conflict.

We continue to have greater reliance on our and our third parties’ remote access tools and technology, and employees’ personal systems and increased data utilization and dependence upon our information systems to operate our businesses remotely, including as a result of evolving customer preferences, which has led to increased reliance on digital banking and other digital services provided by our businesses. Effective management of our business continuity increasingly depends on the security, reliability and adequacy of such systems.

We also rely on our employees, representatives and third parties in our day-to-day operations, who may, due to illness, unavailability, the emergence or continuation of health emergencies or pandemics, human error, misconduct (including errors in judgment, malice, fraud or illegal activity), malfeasance or a failure or breach of information systems, cause disruptions to our organization and expose us to operational losses, regulatory risk and reputational harm. Our and our third parties’ inability to properly introduce, deploy and manage operational changes, including with regard to internal financial and governance processes, existing products, services and technology, and new product innovations and technology, could also result in additional operational and regulatory risk.

Regardless of the measures we have taken to implement training, procedures, backup systems and other safeguards to support our operations and bolster our operational resilience, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely, including localized or systemic cyber events that result in information systems outages and unavailability of part or all of the internet, cloud services and/or the financial services industry infrastructure (including electronic trading and algorithmic platforms and critical banking activities). Our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems and the financial services industry infrastructure is more limited than with respect to our systems. Weakness in our third parties’ processes or controls could impact our ability to deliver products or services to our clients and expose us to compliance and operational risks.

There can be no assurance that our business continuity and information security response plans will effectively mitigate our operational risks. Any backup systems or manual processes may not process data accurately and/or as quickly or effectively as our primary systems, and some data might not have been backed up. Additionally, the speed in which we are able to remediate any failure or disruption of our operations and/or information systems may vary across jurisdictions. We regularly update the information systems we rely on to support our operations and growth as part of our efforts to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations globally. This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new or modified information systems and integrating them with existing information systems, including business interruptions.

A failure or breach of our or our third parties’ operations or information systems resulting in disruption to our critical 

Bank of America  14

business operations and customer services, a failure to identify or effectively respond to operational risks in a timely manner and/or a failure to continue to deliver our services through an operational disruption could impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data and expose us to a number of risks, including market abuse, customer attrition, regulatory, market, privacy and liquidity risk, adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition and cause legal, regulatory or reputational harm.

The Corporation and third parties with whom we interact and/or on whom we rely, are subject to cybersecurity incidents, information and security breaches, and technology failures that have and in the future could adversely affect our ability to conduct our businesses, result in the misuse, destruction or disclosure of information, damage our reputation, increase our regulatory and legal risks, result in additional costs or financial losses and/or otherwise adversely impact our businesses and results of operations.

Our business is highly dependent on the security, controls and efficacy of our information systems, and the information systems of our customers, third parties, the financial services industry and financial data aggregators with whom we interact, on whom we rely or who have access to our customers' personal or account information. We rely on effective access management and the secure collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination and disposition of information in our and our third parties’ information systems. Our cybersecurity risk and exposure remains heightened because of, among other things, our prominent size and scale, high-profile brand, geographic footprint and international presence and role in the financial services industry and the broader economy. The proliferation of third-party financial data aggregators and emerging technologies, including our and our third parties’ use of automation, artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, increases our cybersecurity risks and exposure.

We, our employees, customers, regulators and third parties are ongoing targets of an increasing number of cybersecurity threats and cyberattacks. The tactics, techniques and procedures used in cyberattacks are pervasive, sophisticated and designed to evade security measures, including computer viruses, malicious or destructive code (such as ransomware), social engineering (including phishing, vishing and smishing), denial of service or information or other security breach tactics that have and in the future could result in disruptions to our businesses and operations and the loss of funds, including from attempts to defraud us and/or our customers, and impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our information, including intellectual property, or that of our employees, customers and third parties. Cyberattacks are carried out on a worldwide scale and by a growing number of actors, including organized crime groups, hackers, terrorist organizations, extremist parties, hostile foreign governments, state-sponsored actors, activists, disgruntled employees and other persons or entities, including those involved in corporate espionage.

Cybersecurity threats and the tactics, techniques and procedures used in cyberattacks change, develop and evolve rapidly, including from emerging technologies, such as AI, machine learning and quantum computing. Despite substantial efforts to protect the integrity and resilience of our information systems and implement controls, processes, policies, employee training and other protective measures, we are not able to anticipate and/or detect all cybersecurity threats and incidents and/or develop or implement effective preventive or defensive measures designed to prevent, respond to or mitigate all cybersecurity threats and incidents. Internal access 

management failures could impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data. Additionally, the failure of our employees to exercise sound judgment and vigilance when targeted with social engineering or other cyberattacks increases our vulnerability.

Our risk from and exposure to cybersecurity threats and incidents, information and security breaches and technology failures continues to increase due to the acceptance and use of digital banking and other digital products and services, including mobile banking products, and reliance on remote access tools and technology, which have increased our reliance on virtual or digital interactions and a larger number of access points to our information systems that must be secured, and results in greater amounts of information being available for access. Greater demand on our information systems and security tools and processes will likely continue.

We also face significant third-party technology, cybersecurity and operational risks relating to the large number of customers and third parties with whom we do business, the financial services industry, upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities or upon whom our customers rely, including the secure collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination and disposition of customer and other sensitive information, providers of products and/or services, financial counterparties, financial data aggregators, financial intermediaries, such as clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses, regulators, providers of outsourced infrastructure, such as internet access, cloud service providers and electrical power, and retailers for whom we process transactions. Such third-party information systems extend beyond our security and control systems, and such third parties have varying levels of security and cybersecurity resources, expertise, safeguards, controls and capabilities. Threat actors may actively seek to exploit security and cybersecurity weaknesses at our third parties and the relationships of our third parties with us may increase the risk that they are targeted by the same threats we face, and such third parties may be less prepared for such threats. We are also at additional risk resulting from critical third-party information security and open-source software vulnerabilities. We must rely on our third parties to adequately detect and promptly report cybersecurity incidents, and their failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to report or respond to cybersecurity incidents effectively or timely.

Due to increasing consolidation, interdependence and complexity of financial entities and technology and information  systems, a cybersecurity threat or incident, information or security breach or technology failure that significantly exposes, degrades, destroys or compromises the information systems or information of one or more financial entities or third parties could adversely impact us and increase the risk of operational failure and loss, as disparate systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis. Similarly, any cybersecurity threat or incident, information or security breach or technology failure that significantly exposes, degrades, destroys or compromises our information systems or information could adversely impact third parties and the critical infrastructure of the financial services industry, thereby creating additional risk for us.

Cybersecurity incidents or information or security breaches could persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and it often takes additional time to determine the scope, extent, amount and type of impact, including information altered, destroyed or otherwise compromised, following which the measures to recover and restore to a business-as-usual state may be difficult to assess. We have spent and expect to continue to spend significant resources to modify and enhance 

15  Bank of America

our protective measures, investigate and remediate software and network vulnerabilities, and defend against, detect and respond to cybersecurity threats and incidents whether specific to us, a third party, the industry or businesses in general, and enhance our capabilities to respond and recover.

While we and our third parties have experienced cybersecurity incidents, information and security breaches and technology failures, as well as adverse impacts from such events, including as described in this risk factor, we have not experienced material losses or other material consequences relating to cybersecurity incidents, information or security breaches or technology failures, whether directed at us or our third parties. However, we expect to continue to experience such events and impacts with increased frequency and severity due to the evolving threat environment, and there can be no assurance that future cybersecurity incidents, information and security breaches and technology failures, including as a result of cybersecurity incidents, information and security breaches and technology failures experienced by our third parties, will not have a material adverse impact on us, including our businesses, results of operations and financial condition.

Any future cybersecurity incident, information or security breach or technology failure suffered by us or our third parties could result in disruption to our day-to-day business activities, an inability to effect transactions, execute trades, service our customers, manage our exposure to risk, expand our businesses, detect and prevent fraudulent or unauthorized transactions, including transactions impacting our customers, maintain information systems access and business operations and customer services, in the U.S. and/or globally. Additionally, we could experience the loss of customers and business opportunities, the withdrawal of customer deposits, the misappropriation, alteration or destruction of our or our third parties’ intellectual property or confidential information, the unauthorized access to or temporary or permanent loss or theft of personally identifiable information, including of our employees and customers, significant lost revenue, losses and claims brought by third parties, violations of applicable privacy, cybersecurity and other laws, rules and regulations, litigation exposure, economic sanctions, enforcement actions, government fines, penalties or intervention and other negative consequences. Although we maintain cyber insurance, there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we may incur will be covered under such policies or that the amount of insurance will be adequate. In addition, in the case of any cybersecurity incident, information or security breach or technology failure arising from third-party systems impacting us, any third-party indemnification may not be applicable or sufficient to address the impact of such cybersecurity incidents, information or security breaches or technology failures, including monetary losses of the Corporation. The occurrence of any of the events described above could adversely impact our businesses, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm, whether such events are actual or perceived.

Failure to satisfy our obligations as servicer for residential mortgage securitizations, loans owned by other entities and other related losses could adversely impact our reputation, servicing costs or results of operations.

We service mortgage loans on behalf of third-party securitization vehicles and other investors. If we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer or master servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice, which could cause us to lose servicing income. We may also have liability for any failure by us, as a servicer or master servicer, for 

any act or omission on our part that involves willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of our duties. If any such breach was found to have occurred, it may harm our reputation, increase our servicing costs or losses due to potential indemnification obligations, result in litigation or regulatory action or adversely impact our results of operations. Additionally, foreclosures may result in costs, litigation or losses due to irregularities in the underlying documentation, or if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower or overturned by a court because of errors or deficiencies in the foreclosure process. We may also incur costs or losses relating to delays or alleged deficiencies in processing documents necessary to comply with state law governing foreclosure.

Changes in the structure of and relationship among the GSEs could adversely impact our business.

We rely on the GSEs to guarantee or purchase mortgage loans that meet their conforming loan requirements. During 2023, we sold approximately $3.1 billion of loans to GSEs, primarily Freddie Mac (FHLMC). FHLMC and Fannie Mae (FNMA) are currently in conservatorship, with the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) acting as conservator. In 2019, the Treasury Department published a proposal to recapitalize FHLMC and FNMA and remove them from conservatorship and reduce their role in the marketplace. In January 2021, the Treasury Department further amended the agreement that governs the conservatorship of FHLMC and FNMA and delineated the continued objective to remove the GSEs from conservatorship. However, we cannot predict the future prospects of the GSEs, timing of the recapitalization or release from conservatorship, or content of legislative or rulemaking proposals regarding the future status of the GSEs in the housing market. If the GSEs take a reduced role in the marketplace, including by limiting the mortgage products they offer, we could be required to seek alternative funding sources, retain additional loans on our balance sheet, secure funding through the Federal Home Loan Bank system, or securitize the loans through Private Label Securitization, which could increase our cost of funds related to the origination of new mortgage loans, increase credit risk and/or impact our capacity to originate new mortgage loans. Uncertainty regarding their future and the MBS they guarantee continues to exist for the foreseeable future. These developments could adversely affect our securities portfolios, capital levels, liquidity and results of operations.

Our risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for losses.

Our risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss to us. We seek to effectively and consistently identify, measure, monitor, report and control the key types of risk to which we are subject, including strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. Risks also may span across multiple key risk types, including cybersecurity risk, climate risk and legal risk. While we employ a broad and diversified set of controls and risk mitigation techniques, including modeling and forecasting, hedging strategies and techniques that seek to balance our ability to profit from trading positions with our exposure to potential losses, our ability to control and mitigate risks that result in losses is inherently limited by our ability to identify and measure all risks, including emerging and unknown risks, anticipate the timing and impact of risks, apply effective hedging strategies, make correct assumptions, manage and aggregate data correctly and efficiently, identify changes in markets or client behaviors not yet inherent in historical data and develop risk management models and forecasts to assess and control risk.

Bank of America  16

Our ability to manage risk is dependent on our ability to consistently execute all elements of our risk management program, develop and maintain a culture of managing risk well throughout the Corporation and manage risks associated with third parties, including providers of products and/or services, to allow for effective risk management and help confirm that risks are appropriately considered, evaluated and responded to in a timely manner. Uncertain economic and geopolitical conditions, health emergencies and pandemics, heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of and change within the financial services industry, the pace of technological changes, accounting, tax and market developments, the failure of employees, representatives and third parties to comply with our policies and Risk Framework and the overall complexity of our operations, among other developments, have in the past and may in the future result in a heightened level of risk, including operational, reputational and compliance risk. Our failure to manage evolving risks or properly anticipate, manage, control or mitigate risks could result in additional losses and adversely affect our results of operations.

Regulatory, Compliance and Legal

We are highly regulated and subject to evolving government legislation and regulations and certain settlements, orders and agreements with government authorities from time to time.

Our businesses are highly regulated and we are subject to evolving and comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws in the U.S. and the laws of the various foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, including increasing and complex economic sanctions regimes. These laws and regulations significantly affect and have the potential to restrict the scope of our existing businesses, require changes to our business strategies, limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, including the products and services we offer, reduce certain fees and rates and/or make our products and services more expensive for our clients. We are also required to file various financial and nonfinancial regulatory reports to comply with laws, rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which results in additional compliance risk.

We continue to adjust our business and operations, legal entity structure, disclosure and policies, processes, procedures and controls, including with regard to capital and liquidity management, risk management and data management, in an effort to comply with laws, rules and regulations, as well as evolving expectations, guidance and interpretation by regulatory authorities, including the Department of Treasury (including the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and OFAC), Federal Reserve, OCC, CFPB, Financial Stability Oversight Council, FDIC, Department of Labor, SEC and CFTC in the U.S., foreign regulators, other government authorities and self-regulatory organizations. Further, we expect to become subject to future laws, rules and regulations beyond those currently proposed, adopted or contemplated in the U.S. or abroad, as well as evolving interpretations of existing and future laws, rules and regulations, which may include policies and rulemaking related to FDIC assessments, loss allocations between financial institutions and customers with regard to the use of our products and services, including electronic payments, emerging technologies, such as the development and use of AI and machine learning, cybersecurity and data, and further climate risk management and ESG reporting, including emissions and sustainability disclosure. The cumulative effect of all of the current and possible future legislation and regulations, as well as related interpretations, on our litigation and regulatory exposure, businesses, operations and profitability remains uncertain and necessitates that we make certain assumptions 

with respect to the scope and requirements of existing, prospective and proposed laws, rules and regulations in our business planning and strategies. If these assumptions prove incorrect, we could be subject to increased regulatory, legal and compliance risks and costs, as well as potential reputational harm. Also, U.S. and regulatory initiatives abroad may overlap, and non-U.S. regulation and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed U.S. regulations, which could lead to compliance risks and increased costs.

Our regulators’ prudential and supervisory authority gives them broad power and discretion to direct our actions, and they have assumed an active oversight, inspection and investigatory role across the financial services industry. Regulatory focus is not limited to laws, rules and regulations applicable to the financial services industry, but includes other significant laws, rules and regulations that apply across industries and jurisdictions, including those related to anti-money laundering, anti-bribery, anti-corruption know-your-customer requirements, embargo programs and economic sanctions.

We are also subject to laws, rules and regulations in the U.S. and abroad, including the GDPR and CCPA as modified by the CPRA, and a number of additional jurisdictions enacting or considering similar laws or amendments to existing laws, regarding privacy and the disclosure, collection, use, sharing and safeguarding of personally identifiable information, including our employees, customers, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties, the violation of which could result in litigation, regulatory fines, enforcement actions and operational loss. Additionally, we are and will continue to be subject to new and evolving data privacy laws in the U.S. and abroad, which could result in additional costs of compliance, litigation, regulatory fines and enforcement actions. There remains complexity and uncertainty, including potential suspension or prohibition, regarding data transfer because of concerns over compliance with laws, rules and regulations for cross-border flows and transfers of personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA) to the U.S. and other jurisdictions outside of the EEA, resulting from judicial and regulatory guidance. To the extent that a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework leads to a relaxation of applicable legislation and regulations, regardless of transfer mechanism, challenges are expected from consumer advocacy groups. Other jurisdictions, including China and India, have commenced consultation efforts or enacted new legislation or regulations to establish standards for personal data transfers. If cross-border personal data transfers are suspended or restricted or we are required to implement distinct processes for each jurisdiction’s standards, this could result in operational disruptions to our businesses, additional costs, increased enforcement activity, new contract negotiations with third parties, and/or modification of such data management.

As part of their enforcement authority, our regulators and other government authorities have the authority to, among other things, conduct investigations and assess significant civil or criminal monetary fines, penalties or restitution, issue cease and desist orders, suspend or withdraw licenses and authorizations, initiate injunctive action, apply regulatory sanctions or cause us to enter into consent orders. The amounts paid by us and other financial institutions to settle proceedings or investigations have, in some instances, been substantial and may increase. In some cases, governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms as part of such resolutions, which could have significant consequences, including reputational harm, loss of customers, restrictions on the ability to access capital markets, and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products. 

17  Bank of America

Our response to regulators and other government authorities may be time-consuming, expensive and divert management attention from our business. The outcome of any matter, which may last years, may be difficult to predict or estimate.

The terms of settlements, orders and agreements that we have entered into with government entities and regulatory authorities have also imposed, or could impose, significant operational and compliance costs on us with respect to enhancements to our procedures and controls, losses with respect to fraudulent transactions perpetrated against our customers, expansion of our risk and control functions within our lines of business, investment in technology and the hiring of significant numbers of additional risk, control and compliance personnel. If we fail to meet the requirements of the regulatory settlements, orders or agreements to which we are subject, or, more generally, fail to maintain risk and control procedures and processes that meet the heightened standards established by our regulators and other government authorities, we could be required to enter into further settlements, orders or agreements and pay additional fines, penalties or judgments, or accept material regulatory restrictions on our businesses.

Improper actions, behaviors or practices by us, our employees or representatives that are illegal, unethical or contrary to our core values could harm us, our shareholders or customers or damage the integrity of the financial markets, and are subject to regulatory scrutiny across jurisdictions. The complexity of the regulatory and enforcement regimes in the U.S., coupled with the global scope of our operations and the regulatory environment worldwide, also means that a single event or practice or a series of related events or practices may give rise to a significant number of overlapping investigations and regulatory proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies in the U.S. or by multiple regulators and other governmental entities in different jurisdictions. Actions by other members of the financial services industry related to business activities in which we participate may result in investigations by regulators or other government authorities.

While we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs, compliance risks will continue to exist, particularly as we anticipate and adapt to new and evolving laws, rules and regulations and evolving interpretations. We also rely upon third parties who may expose us to compliance and legal risk. Future legislative or regulatory actions, and any required changes to our business or operations or strategy, or those of third parties upon whom we rely, resulting from such developments and actions could result in a significant loss of revenue, impose additional compliance and other costs or otherwise reduce our profitability, limit the products and services that we offer or our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, require us to dispose of certain businesses or assets, require us to curtail certain businesses, affect the value of assets that we hold, necessitate changes in our compensation practices, require us to increase our prices and therefore reduce demand for our products, or otherwise adversely affect our businesses.

We are subject to significant financial and reputational risks from potential liability arising from lawsuits and regulatory and government action.

We face significant legal risks in our business, with a high volume of claims against us and other financial institutions. The amount of damages, penalties and fines that litigants and regulators seek from us and other financial institutions continues to be significant. This includes disputes with consumers, customers and other counterparties.

Financial institutions, including us, continue to be the subject of claims alleging anti-competitive conduct with respect to various products and markets, including U.S. antitrust class actions claiming joint and several liability for treble damages. As disclosed in Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we also face contractual indemnification and loan-repurchase claims arising from alleged breaches of representations and warranties in the sale of residential mortgages by legacy companies, which may result in a requirement that we repurchase the mortgage loans, or make whole or provide other remedies to counterparties.

U.S. regulators and government agencies regularly pursue enforcement claims against financial institutions, including us, for alleged violations of law and customer harm, including under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act, the federal securities laws, the False Claims Act, fair lending laws and regulations (including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act), the FCPA, the BSA, regulations issued by OFAC, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws and regulations related to products and services such as overdraft and sales practices, including prohibitions on unfair, deceptive, and/or abusive acts and practices (UDAAP) under the Consumer Financial Protection Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act, and EFTA, as well as other enforcement action taken by prudential regulators with respect to safety, soundness and appropriateness of our business practices. Such claims may carry significant penalties, restitution and, in certain cases, treble damages, and the ultimate resolution of regulatory inquiries, investigations and other proceedings which we are subject to from time-to-time is difficult to predict.

There is also an increased focus on information security. This includes cybersecurity incidents perpetrated against us, our customers, providers of products and services, counterparties and other third parties, the collection, use and sharing of data, and safeguarding of personally identifiable information and corporate data, as well as the development, implementation, use and management of emerging technologies, including AI and machine learning. Related litigation or government enforcement, including with regard to compliance with U.S. and global laws, rules and regulations, could subject us to fines, judgments and/or settlements and involve reputational losses. Additionally, misconduct by our employees and representatives, including unethical, fraudulent, improper or illegal conduct, the failure to fulfill fiduciary obligations, unfair, deceptive, abusive or discriminatory business practices, or violations of policies, procedures, laws, rules or regulations, including conduct that affects compliance with books and records requirements, have resulted and could result in further litigation and/or government investigations and enforcement actions, and cause significant reputational harm. In particular, we are the subject of litigation and regulatory and government inquiries regarding our processing of electronic payments, our efforts to detect, prevent and address fraud perpetrated against our customers and/or the handling of fraud-related disputes, which could result in fines, judgments, and/or settlements, as well as adversely affect our businesses and strategies due to the treatment of loss allocations between customers and us, all of which could also have an adverse impact on other similar products and services. We are also subject to increasing scrutiny of sustainability-related policies, goals, targets and disclosure, which could result in litigation, regulatory investigations and actions and reputational harm.

The global environment of extensive investigations, regulation, regulatory compliance burdens, litigation and 

Bank of America  18

regulatory enforcement, combined with uncertainty related to the continually evolving regulatory environment, have affected and will likely continue to affect operational and compliance costs and risks, including the adaptation of business strategies and/or limitation or cessation of our ability or feasibility to continue providing certain products and services. Lawsuits and regulatory actions have resulted in and will likely continue to result in judgments, orders, settlements, penalties and fines adverse to us. Further, we entered into orders with certain government agencies regarding credit card sales and marketing practices and the representment of non-sufficient fund fees, as well as our participation in implementing government relief measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic and other federal and state government assistance programs, including the processing of unemployment benefits for California and certain other states, and continue to be involved in related litigation that may result in judgments and/or settlements. Litigation and investigation costs, substantial legal liability or significant regulatory or government action against us could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, including liquidity, and results of operations, and/or cause significant reputational harm.

U.S. federal banking agencies may require us to increase our regulatory capital, total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC), long-term debt or liquidity requirements.

We are subject to U.S. regulatory capital and liquidity rules. These rules, among other things, establish minimum requirements to qualify as a well-capitalized institution. If any of our subsidiary insured depository institutions fail to maintain their status as well capitalized under the applicable regulatory capital rules, the Federal Reserve will require us to agree to bring the insured depository institution back to well-capitalized status. For the duration of such an agreement, the Federal Reserve may impose restrictions on our activities. If we were to fail to enter into or comply with such an agreement,  the Federal Reserve may impose more severe restrictions on our activities, including requiring us to cease and desist activities permitted under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956.

Capital and liquidity requirements are frequently introduced and amended. Regulators may increase regulatory capital requirements, including TLAC and long-term debt requirements, change how regulatory capital or RWA is calculated or increase liquidity requirements. In 2023, U.S. banking regulators issued proposals to revise the calculation of the G-SIB surcharge and TLAC and long-term debt requirements. Our ability to return capital to our shareholders depends in part on our ability to maintain regulatory capital levels above minimum requirements plus buffers. To the extent that increases occur in our SCB, G-SIB surcharge or countercyclical capital buffer, our returns of capital to shareholders, including common stock dividends and common stock repurchases, could decrease. For example, our G-SIB surcharge increased by 50 bps to 3.0 percent on January 1, 2024. The Federal Reserve could also limit or prohibit capital actions, such as paying or increasing dividends or repurchasing common stock, as a result of economic disruptions or events.

As part of its annual CCAR, we are subject to extensive regulatory evaluation of capital planning practices by the Federal Reserve, including stress testing on parts of our business using hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by the Federal Reserve. Those scenarios may affect our CCAR stress test results, which may impact our SCB level, requiring us to hold additional capital or causing changes in required capital buffers.

A significant component of regulatory capital ratios is calculating our RWA and our leverage exposure. In July 2023, U.S. banking regulators issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to revise several key methodologies for measuring RWA, 

including a standardized approach for operational risk, revised market risk and credit risk requirements and removal of the use of certain internal models, which would increase our regulatory capital requirements, if adopted as proposed. Economic disruptions or events may also cause an increase in our balance sheet, RWA or leverage exposures, increasing required regulatory capital and liquidity amounts.

Changes to and compliance with the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements may impact our operations by requiring us to liquidate assets, increase borrowings, issue additional equity or other securities, reduce the amount of common stock repurchases or dividends, cease or alter certain operations, pricing strategies and business activities or hold highly liquid assets, which may adversely affect our results of operations.

Changes in accounting standards or assumptions in applying accounting policies could adversely affect us.

Accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or liabilities and results of operations and are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. If assumptions, estimates or judgments are erroneously applied, we could be required to correct and restate prior-period financial statements. Accounting standard-setters and those who interpret the accounting standards, including the SEC, banking regulators and our independent registered public accounting firm may also amend or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various standards should be applied. These changes may be difficult to predict and could impact the preparation and reporting of our financial statements, including the application of new or revised standards retrospectively, resulting in revisions to prior-period financial statements.

We may be adversely affected by changes in U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws and regulations.

Governmental authorities in the U.S. and/or other countries could further change tax laws in a way that would materially adversely affect us, including changes to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Also, new guidelines issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which are currently being enacted into law in some OECD countries in which we operate, are expected to impose a 15 percent global minimum tax on a country-by-country basis. Any implementation of and/or change in tax laws and regulations or interpretations of current or future tax laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax liabilities and results of operations. U.S. and foreign tax laws are complex and our judgments, interpretations or applications of such tax laws could differ from that of the relevant governmental authority. This could result in additional tax liabilities and interest, penalties, the reduction of certain tax benefits and/or the requirement to make adjustments to amounts recorded, which could be material.

Additionally, we have U.K. net deferred tax assets (DTA) which consist primarily of net operating losses that are expected to be realized by certain subsidiaries over an extended number of years. Adverse developments with respect to tax laws or to other material factors, such as prolonged worsening of Europe’s capital markets or changes in the ability of our U.K. subsidiaries to conduct business in the EU, could lead our management to reassess and/or change its current conclusion that no valuation allowance is necessary with respect to our U.K. net DTA.

Reputation

Damage to our reputation could harm our businesses, including our competitive position and business prospects.

Our ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors and employees is impacted by our reputation. Harm to our reputation can arise from various sources, including actual or perceived activities of our officers, directors, employees, other representatives, customers and third parties, including counterparties, such as fraud, misconduct and unethical behavior (such as employees’ sales practices), adequacy of our ability to detect, prevent and/or respond to fraud perpetrated against our customers, and the handling of related disputes with regard to the use of our products and services, including electronic payments, effectiveness of our internal controls, the fees charged to our customers, including overdraft and non-sufficient fund fees, compensation practices, lending practices, suitability or reasonableness of particular trading or investment strategies, the reliability of our research and models and prohibiting clients from engaging in certain transactions.

Our reputation may also be harmed by actual or perceived failure to deliver the products and standards of service and quality expected by our customers, clients and the community, including the overstatement or mislabeling of the environmental benefits of our products, services or transactions, the failure to protect our customers and/or recognize and address customer complaints, compliance failures, technology changes, the implementation, management and/or use of emerging technologies, including quantum computing, AI and machine learning, the failure to maintain effective data management, cybersecurity incidents and information and security breaches affecting us and our third parties, which have occurred and we expect to continue to experience with increased frequency and severity due to the evolving threat environment, prolonged or repeated system outages, the Corporation’s privacy policies, the unintended disclosure of or failure to safeguard personal, proprietary or confidential information, the breach of the Corporation’s fiduciary obligations and handling of the emergence or continuation of health emergencies and pandemics. Our reputation may be also be harmed by litigation and/or regulatory matters and their outcomes, relating to the topics discussed above or otherwise. For example, we entered into orders with certain government agencies regarding credit card sales and marketing practices and the representment of non-sufficient fund fees, as well as our processing of unemployment benefits for California and certain other states, and continue to be involved in related litigation, which may result in judgments and/or settlements. Challenges to our ESG practices and disclosures, and those of our customers and third parties, including from diverging views regarding ESG-related practices and disclosures may also harm our reputation.

Increases in market interest rates have resulted in increased focus on asset and liability management, including HTM and AFS securities and related unrealized losses. Perceptions of our liquidity and financial condition, actions by the financial services industry generally, or by certain members or individuals in the industry may harm our reputation. Adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media by employees, the media or otherwise, whether or not factually correct, may adversely impact our business prospects and results of operations.

We are subject to complex and evolving laws, regulations and interpretations regarding fair lending activity, UDAAP, electronic funds transfers, know-your-customer requirements, data protection and privacy, including the GDPR and the CCPA as modified by the CPRA, cross-border data movement, 

cybersecurity and other matters, as well as evolving and expansive interpretations of these laws and regulations. Principles concerning the appropriate scope of consumer and commercial privacy vary considerably in different jurisdictions, and regulatory and public expectations regarding the definition and scope of consumer and commercial privacy may remain fluid. These laws may be interpreted and applied by various jurisdictions in a manner inconsistent with our current or future practices, or with one another. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers in our possession, or in the possession of third parties or financial data aggregators, is mishandled, misused or mismanaged, or if we do not timely or adequately address such information, we may face regulatory, legal and operational risks, which could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.

We could suffer reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest. Management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among our clients. The actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to use our products and services, or result in litigation or enforcement actions, which could adversely affect our business.

Our actual or perceived failure to address these and other issues, such as operational risks, could give rise to reputational risk that could harm us and our business prospects, including the attraction and retention of customers and employees. Failure to appropriately address any of these issues could also give rise to additional regulatory restrictions, legal risks and reputational harm, which could, among other consequences, increase the size and number of litigation claims and damages asserted or subject us to enforcement actions, fines and penalties, and cause us to incur related costs and expenses.

Other

Reforms to benchmarks may adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risks and challenges associated with reference rate reform, including the potential replacement of benchmark rates with ARRs (e.g., the expected cessation of BSBY), could expose us to various financial, operational, supervisory, conduct and legal risk.

Usage of ARRs for impacted benchmarks may vary across or within categories of contracts, products and services, potentially resulting in market fragmentation, decreased trading volumes and liquidity, increased complexity and modeling and operational risks. ARRs may have compositions and characteristics that differ from replaced benchmarks, including limited liquidity and less predictable performance over time. Any mismatch between the adoption of ARRs in loans, securities and derivatives markets may impact hedging or other financial arrangements we have implemented, resulting in unanticipated market exposures. Transition to ARRs may adversely affect the yield on loans or securities held by us, amounts paid on our securities and received and paid on derivatives we have entered into, the value of such loans, securities or derivative instruments, the trading market for such products and contracts, and our effective use of hedging instruments to manage risk. There is no assurance that impacted benchmarks will transition to ARRs without delay or potential disputes.

The transition of any products using impacted benchmarks (Impacted Products) that do not include fallback provisions or adequate fallback mechanisms may require additional efforts to modify their terms, and may be more challenging to modify if all 

Bank of America  20

impacted parties are required to consent to such modification. Litigation or other disputes may occur as a result of the interpretation or application of any transition-related legislation or regulations adopted in the U.S. and/or foreign jurisdictions, including if the laws or regulations in jurisdictions overlap.

Impacted Products may contain language giving the Corporation discretion to determine the successor rate (including the applicable spread adjustment) to the existing benchmark. We may face a risk of litigation, disputes or other actions from customers, counterparties, investors or others based on various claims, for example, that we incorrectly interpreted or enforced contract provisions, failed to appropriately communicate the transition effects of ARRs to existing and future products, treated affected parties unfairly or made inappropriate product recommendations to or investments on behalf of our clients, engaged in anti-competitive behavior or unlawfully manipulated markets or benchmarks.

ARR-based products that we develop, launch and/or support may perform differently from Impacted Products during times of economic stress, adverse or volatile market conditions and across the credit and economic cycle, which may impact the value, return on and profitability of our ARR-based assets. New financial products linked to ARRs may have additional legal, financial, accounting, tax, operational, market, compliance, reputational, competitive or other risks to us, our customers and other market participants. Scrutiny by banking regulators in the U.S. and globally on transition plans, preparations and readiness could result in regulatory action, litigation and/or the need to change the products offered by our businesses.

We face significant and increasing competition in the financial services industry.

We operate in a highly competitive environment and experience intense competition from local and global bank and nonbank financial institutions and new entrants in domestic and foreign markets. There is increasing pressure to provide products and services on more attractive terms, including lower fees and higher interest rates on deposits, and lower cost investment strategies, which may impact our ability to effectively compete. The current and changing regulatory environment may also create competitive disadvantages, including from more stringent regulatory requirements applicable to the Corporation.

Emerging technologies and the growth of e-commerce have lowered geographic and monetary barriers of other financial institutions, made it easier for non-depository institutions to offer traditional banking products and services and allowed non-traditional financial service providers and technology companies to compete with traditional financial service companies in providing electronic and internet-based financial solutions and services, including electronic securities trading with low or no fees and commissions, marketplace lending, financial data aggregation and payment processing services, including real-time payment platforms. Further, clients may choose to conduct business with other market participants who engage in business or offer products in areas we deem speculative or risky as an alternative to traditional banking products. Increased competition may reduce our market share, net interest margin and revenues from our fee-based products and services and negatively affect our earnings, including by pressuring us to lower pricing or credit standards, requiring additional investment to improve the quality and delivery of our technology and/or affecting the willingness of our clients to do business with us.

Our inability to adapt our business strategies, products and services could harm our business.

We rely on a diversified mix of businesses that deliver a broad range of financial products and services through multiple 

distribution channels. Our success depends on our and our third-party providers’ ability to timely adapt our business strategies, products and services and their respective features, including available payment processing services and technology to rapidly evolving industry standards and consumer preferences. Our strategies could be further impacted by macroeconomic stress, widespread health emergencies or pandemics, cyberattacks, and military conflicts or other significant geopolitical events.

The widespread adoption and rapid evolution of emerging technologies, including analytic capabilities, self-service digital trading platforms and automated trading markets, internet services, and digital assets, such as central bank digital currencies, cryptocurrencies (including stablecoins), tokens and other cryptoassets that utilize distributed ledger technology (DLT), as well as payment, clearing and settlement processes that use DLT, create additional strategic risks, could negatively impact our ability to compete and require substantial expenditures to the extent we were to modify or adapt our existing products and services. As such new technologies evolve and mature, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted, including as a result of the introduction of new competitors to the payment ecosystem and increased volatility in deposits and/or significant long-term reduction in deposits (i.e., financial disintermediation). Also, we may not be as timely or successful in accurately assessing the competitive landscape and developing or introducing new products and services, integrating new products or services into our existing offerings, responding, managing or adapting to changes in consumer behavior, preferences, spending, investing and/or saving habits, achieving market acceptance of our products and services, reducing costs in response to pressures to deliver products and services at lower prices or sufficiently developing and maintaining customers. Our or our third-party providers’ inability or resistance to timely innovate or adapt its operations, products and services to evolving regulatory and market environments, industry standards and consumer preferences could result in service disruptions and harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and reputation.

We could suffer operational, reputational and financial harm if our models fail to properly anticipate and manage risk.

We use models extensively to forecast losses, project revenue and expenses, assess and control our operations and financial condition, assist in capital planning, manage liquidity and measure, forecast and assess capital and liquidity requirements for credit, market, operational and strategic risks. Under our Enterprise Model Risk Policy, Model Risk Management is required to perform model oversight, including independent validation before initial use, ongoing monitoring reviews through outcomes analysis and benchmarking, and periodic revalidation. However, models are subject to inherent limitations from simplifying assumptions, uncertainty regarding economic and financial outcomes, and emerging risks from applications that rely on AI or machine learning.

Our models may not be sufficiently predictive of future results due to limited historical patterns, extreme or unanticipated market movements or customer behavior and liquidity, especially during severe market downturns or stress events (e.g., geopolitical or pandemic events), which could limit their effectiveness and require timely recalibration. The models that we use to assess and control our market risk exposures also reflect assumptions about the degree of correlation among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators, which may not be representative of the next downturn and would magnify the limitations inherent in using historical data to 

21  Bank of America

manage risk. Market conditions in recent years have involved unprecedented dislocations and highlight the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk. Our models may also be adversely impacted by human error and may not be effective if we fail to properly oversee and review them at regular intervals and detect their flaws during our review and monitoring processes, they contain erroneous data, assumptions, valuations, formulas or algorithms or our applications running the models do not perform as expected. Regardless of the steps we take to help confirm effective controls, governance, monitoring and testing, and implement new technology and automated processes, we could suffer operational, reputational and financial harm, including funding or liquidity shortfalls, if models fail to properly anticipate and manage risks.

Failure to properly manage data may result in our inability to manage risk and business needs, errors in our operations, critical reporting and strategic decision-making, inaccurate reporting and non-compliance with laws, rules and regulations.

We rely on our ability to manage and process data in an accurate, timely and complete manner, including capturing, transporting, aggregating, using, transmitting data externally, and retaining and protecting data appropriately. While we continually update our policies, programs, processes and practices and implement emerging technologies, such as automation, AI, machine learning and robotics, our data management processes may not be effective and are subject to weaknesses and failures, including human error, data limitations, process delays, system failure or failed controls. Failure to properly manage data effectively in an accurate, timely and complete manner may adversely impact its quality and reliability and our ability to manage current and emerging risk, produce accurate financial and/or nonfinancial, regulatory, operational and ESG reporting, detect or surveil potential misconduct or non-compliance with laws, rules and regulations, and to manage changing business needs, strategic decision-making, resolution strategy and operations. The failure to establish and maintain effective, efficient and controlled data management could adversely impact our ability to develop our products and relationships with customers, increase regulatory risk and operational losses, and damage our reputation.

Our operations, businesses and customers could be adversely affected by the impacts related to climate change.

Climate change and related environmental sustainability matters present short-term and long-term risks. The physical risks include an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters, including floods, wildfires, hurricanes and tornados, and chronic longer-term shifts such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels. Such disasters and effects could adversely impact our facilities, employees and customers’ ability to repay outstanding loans, disrupt the operations of us and our customers or third parties, cause supply chain or distribution network disruptions, damage collateral and/or result in market volatility, rapid deposit outflows or drawdowns of credit facilities, the deterioration of the value of collateral or insurance shortfalls.

There is also increasing risk related to the transition to a low-carbon economy. Changes in consumer preferences or financial condition of our customers and counterparties, market pressures, advancements in technology and additional legislation, regulatory, compliance and legal requirements could alter our strategic planning and the scope of our existing businesses, limit our ability to pursue certain business activities and offer certain products and services, amplify credit and market risks, negatively impact asset values, require capital expenditures and changes in technology and markets, including 

supply chain and insurance availability and cost, increase expenses, impact capital requirements and adversely impact our results of operations. In particular, there is an increasing global regulatory focus, including state, federal and non-U.S. jurisdictions, on climate change resulting in new or heightened regulatory requirements, with potential jurisdictional divergence, which is expected to increase our legal, compliance and public disclosure risks and costs in the U.S. and globally.

Our climate change strategies, policies, and disclosures, our ability to achieve our climate-related goals, targets and commitments and/or the environmental or climate impacts attributable to our products, services or transactions will likely result in heightened legal and compliance risk and could result in reputational harm as a result of negative public sentiment, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and reduced investor and stakeholder confidence. Due to divergent views of stakeholders, we are at increased risk that any action, or lack thereof, by us concerning our response to climate change will be perceived negatively by some stakeholders, which could adversely impact our reputation and businesses. Our ability to meet our climate-related goals, targets and commitments, including our goal to achieve certain greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets by 2030 and net zero GHG emissions in our financing activities, operations and supply chain before 2050, is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, such as technological advances, clearly defined roadmaps for industry sectors, public policies and better emissions data reporting, and ongoing engagement with customers, suppliers, investors, government officials and other stakeholders. Due to the evolving nature of climate-related risks, which are expected to increase over time, it is difficult to predict, identify, monitor and effectively mitigate climate-related risks and uncertainties.

Furthermore, there are and will continue to be challenges related to the availability and capturing, measuring, verifying, analyzing and disclosing climate-related data, including data obtained from third parties, which may result in legal, compliance and/or reputational harm.

Our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees is critical to our success, business prospects and competitive position.

Our performance and competitive position is heavily dependent on the talents, development and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Competition for qualified personnel is intense from within and outside the financial services industry.

Our competitors include global institutions and institutions subject to different compensation and hiring regulations than those imposed on U.S. institutions and financial institutions. Also, our ability to attract, develop and retain employees could be impacted by changing workforce concerns, expectations, practices and preferences (including remote work), and increasing labor shortages and competition for labor, which could increase labor costs.

In order to attract and retain qualified personnel, we must provide market-level compensation. As a large financial and banking institution, we are and may become subject to additional limitations on compensation practices by the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC and other regulators globally, which may or may not affect our competitors. Furthermore, because a substantial portion of compensation paid to many of our employees is long-term equity-based awards based on the value of our common stock, declines in our profitability or outlook could adversely affect the ability to attract and retain employees. If we are unable to continue to attract, develop and retain qualified individuals, our business prospects and competitive position could be adversely affected.
