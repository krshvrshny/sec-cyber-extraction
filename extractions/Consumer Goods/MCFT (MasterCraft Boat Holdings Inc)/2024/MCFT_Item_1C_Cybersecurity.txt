ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY

  Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy

  We have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our critical systems and information. Our security approach is aligned with applicable security and/or technical requirements and best practices established by multiple cybersecurity frameworks, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) and ISO 27001. This does not imply that we meet any particular technical standards, specifications or requirements, only that our information security team uses the NIST CSF, ISO 27001 and other frameworks as guides to help us identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business.

  Our cybersecurity risk management program is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management program, and shares common methodologies, reporting channels and governance processes that apply across our enterprise risk management program to other legal, compliance, strategic, operational and financial risk areas.

  Our cybersecurity risk management program includes:

  •risk assessments designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, products, services and our broader enterprise IT environment;

  •a security team principally responsible for managing (i) our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, (ii) our security controls and (iii) our response to cybersecurity incidents;

  •the use of external service providers, where appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our security controls;

  •cybersecurity awareness training of our employees, incident response personnel and senior management, regarding phishing, malware and other cyber risks;

  •a cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents; and

  •a third-party risk management process for service providers, suppliers and vendors.

  We have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. See Part 1, Item 1A. “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business – Our business operations could be negatively impacted by an outage or breach of our information technology systems, network disruptions, or a cybersecurity event.”

  Cybersecurity Governance

  Our Board considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated to the Audit Committee (the “Committee”) oversight of cybersecurity and other information technology risks. The Committee oversees management’s implementation of our cybersecurity risk management program.

  The Committee receives quarterly reports from management on our cybersecurity risks, and also receives, at least annually, a detailed briefing from management on our cyber risk management program’s status including all strategic initiatives. In addition, management updates the Committee, as necessary, regarding potentially significant cybersecurity incidents consistent with written escalation protocols, as well as incidents with lesser potential impact. The Committee members also receive presentations on cybersecurity topics from our Chief Information Officer (“CIO”), who also serves as our Chief Information Technology Architect & Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”), internal security staff or external experts as part of the Board’s continuing education on topics that impact public companies. The Committee reports to the full Board regarding its activities, including those related to cybersecurity. The full Board also receives briefings from management on our cyber risk management program. 

  Our cybersecurity management team, lead by our CIO, supervises efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, which may include briefings from internal security personnel; threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or private sources, including external consultants engaged by us, and reports produced by security tools deployed in the IT environment. Our CIO reports to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, as well as to the Board 

  19

  and Audit Committee. The CIO has served as our CISO for three years and has more than 20 years of experience in various roles involving managing cybersecurity functions, developing strategies to protect privacy, customer safety and intellectual property, and developing key capabilities such as product security engineering, risk management and cybersecurity governance. The CIO holds a bachelor’s degree in computer science and various certifications which include Certified Ethical Hacker and Certified Chief Information Security Officer, and has 25-plus years of previous software and hardware systems engineering experience.
