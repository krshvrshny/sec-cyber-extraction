Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy

We have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical systems and information. 

Our cybersecurity program was developed by integrating a range of relevant concepts and controls derived from established security frameworks. These include the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and related SOC 2 Control Objectives, as well as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. It is important to note that while these frameworks guide our cybersecurity strategies and help us identify, access, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business, this does not imply certification or that we meet or comply with any specific technical standards, specifications or requirements.

Our cybersecurity risk management program is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management program, and shares common methodologies, reporting channels and governance processes that apply across the enterprise risk management program to other legal, compliance, strategic, operational, and financial risk areas.

Key elements of our cybersecurity risk management program include, but are not limited to, the following:

a.risk assessments designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, products, services, and our broader enterprise IT environment;

b.a security team principally responsible for managing (1) our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, (2) our security controls, and (3) our response to cybersecurity incidents;

c.the use of external service providers, where appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our security processes;

d.cybersecurity awareness training of our employees; 

e.a cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents; and

f.a third-party risk management process for service providers based on our assessment of their criticality to our operations and respective risk profile.

We have not identified any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. We face risks from cybersecurity threats that, if realized, are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.

Cybersecurity Governance

Our Board considers cybersecurity risk and other information technology risks as part of its risk oversight function. The full Board oversees management’s implementation of our cybersecurity risk management program. 

The Board receives periodic reports from management on our cybersecurity risks and our cyber risk management program. Board members receive presentations on cybersecurity topics from our Chief Digital Officer (“CDO”) as part of the Board’s continuing education on topics that impact public companies. In addition, management is prepared to update the Board, as it deems appropriate, regarding cybersecurity incidents it considers to be significant or potentially significant. 

Our CDO has primary responsibility for, and works collaboratively across the Company to implement, our cybersecurity risk management program designed to protect our information systems from cybersecurity threats and to respond to any 

cybersecurity incidents in accordance with our incident response plans. Our CDO leads a team, including a number of cybersecurity professionals, that is responsible for implementing and maintaining centralized cybersecurity and data protection practices in close coordination with senior leadership and other teams across the Company. In addition to our extensive in-house cybersecurity capabilities, at times we also engage consultants, auditors, or other third parties to assist with assessing, identifying, and managing cybersecurity risks. Our CDO leads the core elements of e.l.f. Beauty’s IT and digital functions, including IT infrastructure, systems and security, digital experience and operations, and consumer technology. Our CDO has served in various roles in information technology and information security for over 25 years, and her background includes completing the Harvard Cybersecurity program and active involvement in the Silicon Valley Consortium, focusing on security and technological advancements in cybersecurity and data privacy. As a thought leader in the intersection of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, her expertise aligns with the critical needs of the constantly changing cybersecurity landscape and managing digital risk. Working with our CDO in implementing our cybersecurity risk management program, our Chief Information Security Officer and our Associate Director, IT Infrastructure & Security, collectively have more than 30 years of experience in information technology and extensive education and industry experience managing cybersecurity risks, developing and implementing cybersecurity policies, and responding to cybersecurity incidents.

Our management team takes steps to stay informed about and monitors efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, which may include briefings from internal security personnel; threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or private sources, including external consultants engaged by us; and alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in our IT environment.
