Item 1C.    Cybersecurity

As required by Item 106 of Regulation S-K, the following sets forth certain information regarding our cybersecurity strategy, risk management, and governance.

Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy

We have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program designed to protect critical assets, scale with business growth, identify and mitigate threats, and enable us to conduct our business securely. The program’s design applies concepts from the frameworks of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) as guidelines, incorporating their applicable principles while adapting certain elements to align with our specific operational needs and objectives. The program and other cybersecurity processes have been integrated into our overall risk management framework.

Our cybersecurity risk management program is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management program, and shares common methodologies, reporting channels and governance processes that apply across the enterprise risk management program to other legal, compliance, strategic, operational, and financial risk areas. There can be no assurance that our cybersecurity risk management program and processes, including our policies, controls, or procedures, will be fully implemented, complied with or effective in protecting our systems and information.

Our cybersecurity risk management program includes:

•a security team principally responsible for managing (1) our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, (2) our security controls, and (3) our response to cybersecurity incidents;

•the use of external service providers, where appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our security controls;

•cybersecurity awareness training of our employees, incident response personnel, and senior management; 

•ongoing risk assessments designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, products, services, and our broader enterprise IT environment;

•a cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents; and

•a third-party risk management process for service providers, suppliers, and vendors.

We have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.

Cybersecurity Governance

Our board of directors considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated to the Audit Committee (the "Committee") oversight of cybersecurity and other information technology risks. The Committee oversees management’s implementation of our cybersecurity risk management program. 

The Committee receives regular reports from management on our cybersecurity risks. In addition, management updates the Committee, as necessary, regarding any material cybersecurity incidents, as well as any incidents with lesser impact potential.  The Committee reports to our full board of directors regarding its activities, including those related to cybersecurity. Our full board of directors also receives briefings from management on our cyber risk management program.  

Our management team, including our Chief Information Officer, Senior VP Global IT Operations and IT Security Director, is responsible for assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats. The team has primary responsibility for our overall cybersecurity risk management program and supervises both our internal cybersecurity personnel and our retained external cybersecurity consultants. The cybersecurity team leads dedicated cybersecurity meetings with the Chief Corporate Governance & Compliance Officer and key members of the legal and compliance department. This group meets monthly and regularly reviews key cybersecurity metrics. The information security team monitors public cybersecurity threats and meets with external experts periodically to review these threats and to stay abreast of the evolving threat landscape. The leadership of our cybersecurity team averages approximately 25 years of experience with information technology, with a background deeply rooted in data management and protection and data analytics and brings extensive experience in information security strategy and risk management at Houlihan Lokey and in previous roles.

Our management team supervises efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, which may include briefings from internal security personnel; threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or private sources, including external consultants engaged by us; and alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in the IT environment.
