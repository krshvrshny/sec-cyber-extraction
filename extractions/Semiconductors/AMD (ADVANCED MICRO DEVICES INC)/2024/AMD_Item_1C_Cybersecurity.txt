ITEM 1C.       CYBERSECURITY

Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy

We have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical systems and information. 

We design and assess our program based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF and AI Risk Management Framework). This does not mean that we meet any particular technical standards, specifications, or requirements, but only that we use the NIST CSF as a guide to help us identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business.

Information about cybersecurity risks and our risk management processes is collected, analyzed and considered as part of our overall enterprise risk management program.

Key components of our cybersecurity risk management program include:

•risk assessments designed to help identify cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, services, and our broader enterprise IT environment;

•a security team principally responsible for managing (1) our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, (2) our security controls, and (3) our response to cybersecurity incidents;

•the use of external service providers, where appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our security processes;

•cybersecurity awareness training of our employees, incident response personnel and senior management; 

•a cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents; and

•a third-party cyber risk management process for vendors including, among other things, a security assessment and contracting program for vendors based on their risk profile.

At this time, we have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. We face certain ongoing risks from cybersecurity threats that, if realized, are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. See “Risk Factors - IT outages, data loss, data breaches and cyberattacks could disrupt operations and compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate or cause significant damage to our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.”

Cybersecurity Governance

Our Board considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated to the Audit and Finance Committee (Committee) oversight of cybersecurity and other information technology risks. The Committee oversees management’s implementation of our cybersecurity risk management program. 

The Committee receives quarterly reports from management on our cybersecurity risks. In addition, management updates the Committee, as necessary, regarding any significant cybersecurity incidents.

The Committee reports to the full Board regarding its activities, including those related to cybersecurity. The full Board also receives a briefing from management on our cyber risk management program at least annually. Board members receive presentations on cybersecurity matters from our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), information security team or external experts as part of the Board’s continuing education on topics that impact public companies.

Our management team, led by our CISO and Sr. Director of Information Security, are responsible for assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats. The team has primary responsibility for our overall cybersecurity risk management program and supervises both our internal cybersecurity personnel and any retained external cybersecurity consultants. Our Sr. Director of Information Security has served in various roles in information technology and information security for over 20 years and holds multiple industry-recognized certifications. Our CISO, who is also our Chief Information Officer, has over 20 years of experience managing global IT operations, including strategy, applications, infrastructure, information security, support and execution. 

Our management team, led by our CISO and Sr. Director of Information Security, is informed about and monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, which may include, among other things, briefings with internal security personnel, threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or private sources, including external consultants engaged by us, and alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in our IT environment.
