ITEM 1C.  Cybersecurity

The Board of Directors’ overall risk oversight function includes receiving reports on the Company’s cybersecurity risks and our risk management processes, and assessing whether our risk management strategies are reasonably designed to address such risks.  The Board has delegated this oversight responsibility to our Audit Committee, which reports periodically to the Board as appropriate.

Our Senior Vice President of Global Operations and our Director of Information Security are responsible for ongoing assessment and supervision of cybersecurity risks, supported by a dedicated Information Security team who reports up to those individuals.  Our Director of Information Security has primary oversight of material risks from cybersecurity threats, has over 25 years of experience in cybersecurity-related roles and holds industry-recognized certifications.  Our Senior Vice President of Global Operations and Director of Information Security review and evaluate our cybersecurity readiness through internal cybersecurity measures and metrics, as well as third-party penetration tests and control assessments against industry standards. We also employ various defensive and continuous monitoring techniques designed to escalate potential issues in a timely manner to our Director of Information Security.

Our Director of Information Security meets with the Audit Committee at least twice a year to discuss our cybersecurity risks, strategy, and activities, including cybersecurity incidents and responses, cybersecurity systems testing, third-party activities and related topics.  In addition, we have governance and compliance structures that are designed to elevate issues relating to cybersecurity to executive oﬃcers, and, as appropriate, to the Audit Committee and Board.
