Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock
Our operating results are volatile and difficult to predict. If we fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decrease significantly. Our net revenue and operating results have varied significantly in the past, are difficult to forecast, are subject to numerous factors both within and outside of our control and may fluctuate significantly in the future. As a result, our operating results could fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors. If that occurs, the price of our stock may decline.
Some of the factors that could affect our operating results and the price of our stock include the following:

●   The demand for our products declining in the major end markets we serve and the ability of our products to penetrate additional markets; which may occur due to competitive factors, supply-chain fluctuations, rising inflation or other changes in macroeconomic or geopolitical conditions;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

●   changes in global trade policy, including tariffs, could reduce demand for end products that incorporate our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

●   reliance on international sales activities for a substantial portion of our net revenue;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

●   the volume and timing of orders received from customers;
------------------------------------------------------------

●   our ability to develop and bring to market new products and technologies, including on a timely basis;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

●   unfavorable or uncertain market conditions and risks relating to the adoption, use or application of emerging technologies, including AI, by our customers and in our business;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13





●   undetected defects, quality issues, warranty claims or product recalls related to our products;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

●   failure, disruption, security breaches, or other incidents impacting our information technology infrastructure or information management systems;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

●   interruptions in our information technology systems;
--------------------------------------------------------

●   competitive pressures on selling prices;
--------------------------------------------

●   risks associated with our supply chain including, the volume, cost and timing of delivery of orders placed by us with our wafer foundries and assembly subcontractors, and their ability to procure materials;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

●   our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel;
----------------------------------------------------------

●   our ability to realize the expected benefits of restructuring initiatives designed to reduce costs and create a more efficient organization;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

●   the lengthy timing of our sales cycle;
------------------------------------------

●   the cyclical nature of the power supply industry and cyclical market patterns across different end markets for which our products are used;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

●   earthquakes, fire, global health crises, or other disasters;
----------------------------------------------------------------

●   sales of our products through distributors, which limits our direct interaction with our end customers, reducing our ability to forecast sales and increasing the complexity of our business;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

●   fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen, the Euro and the Swiss franc;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

●   the inability to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

●   expenses we are required to incur (or choose to incur) in connection with litigation;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

●   changes in tax rules and regulations, changes in interpretation of tax rules and regulations, or unfavorable assessments from tax audits may increase the amount of taxes we are required to pay and require management time and attention;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

●   changes in environmental laws and regulations, including with respect to energy consumption and climate change;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

●   current or potential war, domestic or international conflict, political or social instability, or military actions, including the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

●   risks associated with acquisitions and strategic investments;
-----------------------------------------------------------------

●   our ability to successfully integrate, or realize the expected benefits from, our acquisitions;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

●   continued impact of changes in securities laws and regulations, including potential risks resulting from our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting; and
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

●   we have been and may be subject to or involved in litigation, threatened litigation or other disputes, the outcome of which may be difficult to predict, and which may be costly to defend, divert management attention, require us to pay damages or other payments, or restrict the operation of our business.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Risks Related to the Operation and Growth of Our Business
If demand for our products declines in our major end markets and we do not penetrate additional markets, our net revenue will decrease. When our customers are not successful in maintaining high levels of demand for their products, their demand for our products decreases, which adversely affects our operating results. A limited number of applications of our products, such as consumer appliances and cellphone chargers, make up a significant percentage of our net revenue. We expect that a significant level of our net revenue and operating results will continue to be dependent upon these applications in the near term. Demand for end products incorporating our products has been highly cyclical over time and has been impacted by economic downturns; our recent results have been impacted by economic conditions, including softness in housing markets, which affects demand for consumer appliances and inflation. Any economic slowdown or 

14




disruption in the end markets that we serve could cause a slowdown in demand for our ICs, causing our net revenue to decline and potentially result in write-offs of excess or obsolete inventory, which could cause the price of our stock to fall.
We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to penetrate additional markets for our products. We cannot assure that we will be able to overcome the marketing or technological challenges necessary to penetrate additional markets. To the extent that a competitor penetrates additional markets before we do, or takes market share from us in our existing markets, our net revenue and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
Changes in global trade, in particular the escalation and imposition of new and higher tariffs and additional export controls, could reduce demand for end products that incorporate our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results. Further, increased tariffs or the imposition of other barriers to international trade could place pressure on our prices as our customers seek to offset the impact of increased tariffs on them. Compliance with import and export controls could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate these controls.
Although power supplies using our products are designed and distributed worldwide, most of these power supplies are manufactured by our customers in Asia. As a result, our business is subject to risks related to tariffs and other trade protection measures put in place by the United States or other countries, as well as evolving international trade relations, including but not limited to those between the U.S., China, countries in the APAC region and the EU. 
During the year 2025, the United States government imposed and threatened significant additional tariffs on goods imported into the U.S. from most of its trading partners, and, in response, multiple countries imposed or threatened retaliatory tariffs and other actions. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China have escalated and may continue to escalate, including the U.S. increasing tariffs on goods originating in China and China increasing tariffs on goods originating in the U.S. Changes in trade policies and a heightened risk of further increased tariffs or other barriers to international trade could further decrease international demand as many of our customers sell products incorporating our products into international markets.
Existing or future tariffs proposed or imposed on our customers’ products may adversely affect our gross profit margins in the future due to the potential for increased pressure on our selling prices by customers seeking to offset the impact of tariffs on their own products or other products that they purchase. In addition, tariffs could make our customers’ products less attractive relative to products offered by their competitors, that may not be subject to, or as significantly impacted by, similar tariffs. Further or sustained increases in tariffs on imported goods or the failure to resolve current or new international trade disputes could further decrease demand and have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Even if we are able to take measures to mitigate the impacts of existing or future tariffs, there is no guarantee that our efforts will be successful, or that we will be able to fully mitigate such impacts.
Resulting trade disputes, trade restrictions, tariffs and other political tensions between the U.S. and other countries or among countries may also exacerbate unfavorable macroeconomic conditions including inflationary pressures, foreign exchange volatility, financial market instability, and economic recessions or downturns, which may also negatively impact customer demand for our products or services, delay purchases or renewals, limit our ability to obtain equipment, components or raw materials, limit expansion opportunities with customers, limit our access to capital, or otherwise negatively affect our business and operations. Ongoing tariff, trade restrictions and macroeconomic uncertainty also has and may continue to contribute to volatility in the price of our common stock.
In some cases, our products and power supplies using our products are subject to import and export control laws and regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce and trade and economic sanctions, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. As such, licenses and notices may be required to import, export, or re-export our products and power supplies using our products to certain countries and end users or for certain end uses. The process for obtaining necessary licenses or making required notices may be time-consuming or unsuccessful, potentially causing delays in sales or losses of sales opportunities. Trade controls are complex and dynamic regimes and monitoring and ensuring compliance can be challenging. Failure to adhere to such rules and regulations can result in the incurrence of fines, loss of import or export privileges, seizure of products, loss of reputation and other penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and earnings. A change in laws and regulations could restrict our ability to transfer products to previously permitted countries, customers, distributors or others. It is also possible that evolving U.S. export controls may encourage non-U.S. governments to request that our customers purchase from companies not subject to U.S. export controls, thereby harming our business, market position, and financial results. Excessive export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to 

15




new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls.
Furthermore, compliance with import and export controls and implementation of additional tariffs may increase regulatory compliance costs and further affect our business and operating results.
Our international sales activities account for a substantial portion of our net revenue, which subjects us to substantial risks. Sales to customers outside of the U.S. account for, and have accounted for, a large portion of our net revenue. Approximately 98% of our net revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023 was generated by sales to customers outside of the U.S. If our international sales decline and we are unable to increase domestic sales, our revenue and operating results would be harmed. International sales involve a number of risks to us, including:

●   tariffs, protectionist measures and other trade barriers and restrictions;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

●   potential insolvency of international distributors and representatives;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

●   reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

●   the impact of recessionary environments and inflation in the U.S. and other economies where we do business;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

●   global, regional, and local conditions, including, but not limited to, social, economic, political, and supply chain instability related to the uncertainty regarding relationships among countries, including tensions between China and Taiwan and between China and other countries, as well as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

●   the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign and applicable U.S. Federal and state laws; and
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

●   foreign-currency exchange fluctuations.
-------------------------------------------
Our failure to adequately address these risks could reduce our international sales and materially and adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, because substantially all of our foreign sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, increases in the value of the dollar cause the price of our products in foreign markets to rise, making our products more expensive relative to competing products priced in local currencies.
We do not have long-term contracts with any of our customers and if they fail to place, or if they cancel or reschedule orders for our products, our operating results and our business may suffer. Our business is characterized by short-term customer orders and shipment schedules, and the ordering patterns of some of our large customers have been unpredictable in the past and will likely remain unpredictable in the future. Not only does the volume of units ordered by particular customers vary substantially from period to period, but also purchase orders received from particular customers often vary substantially from early oral estimates provided by those customers for planning purposes. In addition, customer orders can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer. In the past, we have experienced customer cancellations of substantial orders for reasons beyond our control, and significant cancellations could occur again at any time. Also, a relatively small number of distributors, OEMs and merchant power supply manufacturers account for a significant portion of our revenue. As a result, any challenges that we face with a key distributor, including the loss of a key distributor, could harm our business. Similarly, although we sell through various distributors, certain end customers account for a significant portion of our revenue. As such, the loss of demand for our products by customers who purchase through different distributors could harm our business even if the impacts through a single distributor are immaterial. 
If our efforts to enhance existing products and introduce new products are not successful, we may not be able to generate demand for our products. Our success depends in significant part upon our ability to develop new ICs for high-voltage power conversion for existing and new markets, to introduce these products in a timely manner and to have these products selected for design into products. New product introduction schedules are subject to the risks and uncertainties that typically accompany development and delivery of complex technologies to the marketplace, including product development delays and defects. We have experienced delays from time to time in completing new product development. If we fail to develop and sell new products in a timely manner in the future, then our net revenue and ability to compete domestically or internationally could decline.
In addition, we cannot be sure that we will be able to adjust to changing market demands as quickly and cost-effectively as necessary to compete successfully. Furthermore, we cannot assure that we will be able to introduce new products in a timely and cost-effective manner or in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or that these products will achieve market acceptance. Our failure, or our customers’ failure, to develop and introduce new products successfully 

16




and in a timely manner would harm our business. In addition, customers may defer or return orders for existing products. While we maintain reserves for potential customer returns, we cannot assure that these reserves will be adequate.
Unfavorable or uncertain market conditions and risks relating to the adoption, use or application of emerging technologies, including AI, by our customers and in our business, may impact financial results and could result in reputational and financial harm and liability. The adoption of AI solutions and other emerging technologies may not develop in the manner or in the time periods we anticipate, and as these markets are still developing and continue to evolve, demand for products and solutions related to or that support such technologies may be unpredictable and may vary significantly from one period to another. In addition, market enthusiasm and capital spending for AI-related infrastructure and applications may be cyclical or volatile. If customers or end markets materially reduce, delay or redirect spending (including due to macroeconomic conditions, budget constraints, changes in technology architectures, a perceived overbuild of AI capacity or other unanticipated reasons), demand for our products could be adversely affected.
These markets may also not develop as anticipated if AI training and inference costs drop materially due to customer adoption of less expensive alternative technologies or approaches, or if customers achieve desired performance using alternative solutions that reduce the need for certain components. Even if these markets evolve in the manner we anticipate, if we do not have timely, competitively priced and market-accepted products available to meet customer needs in these areas, we may miss significant opportunities business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
Our products must meet exacting specifications, and undetected defects, failures or other quality issues may occur which may cause customers to return or stop buying our products and/or impose significant costs to us. Our customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality, performance and reliability, and our products must meet these specifications. ICs encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects, failures or other quality issues when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments. We have from time to time in the past experienced product quality, performance or reliability problems. If defects and failures occur in our products or if or any such failures are alleged to result in bodily injury, death, and/or property damage, we could experience lost revenue, decreased ability to compete, increased costs (including product warranty or liability claims) and costs associated with customer support and product recalls, delays in or cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments and product returns or discounts. Some OEMs expect suppliers to warrant their products for longer periods of time and are increasingly looking to them for contribution when faced with product liability claims or recalls. While we specifically exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions, certain of our contracts may not exclude such liabilities. We carry various commercial liability policies, including umbrella/excess policies which cover certain damages arising out of product defects. These policies may not cover all claims or be of a sufficient amount to fully protect against such claims, and a successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage, or a requirement that we participate in a product recall, could have adverse effects on our business results. Further, in the future, it is possible that we will not be able to obtain insurance coverage in the amounts and for the risks we seek at policy costs and terms we desire. Additionally, if our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results in a recall, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Any failure, disruption or security breach or incident otherwise impacting our information technology infrastructure or information management systems could have an adverse impact on our business and operations. Cyber-attacks have become increasingly more prevalent and much harder to detect, defend against or prevent. As the frequency of cyber-attacks and resulting breaches reported by other businesses and governments increases, we expect to continue to devote significant resources to improve and maintain our IT infrastructure and its security. We have incurred and may in the future incur significant costs in order to implement, maintain and/or update security systems we believe are necessary to protect our IT infrastructure. As the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage or otherwise disrupt systems change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. A breakdown in existing controls and procedures around our cyber-security environment may prevent us from detecting, reporting or responding to cyber incidents in a timely manner and any such breakdown, or any security breach or incident suffered by us of our third-party service providers, could have a material adverse effect including but not limited to interruptions, other disruptions or delays in our business operations, loss of existing or future customers, claims, demands and liabilities and damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, and financial results. We cannot guarantee that our implemented processes for IT and risk mitigation measures will be effective for IT systems under our control.
Furthermore, we rely on products and services provided by third-party suppliers to operate certain critical business systems. We cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partners’ supply 

17




chains have not been or will not be compromised or that they do not or will not in the future contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to or other incident impacting our IT infrastructure, including our products and services, or the third-party information technology systems that support our services.
We have limited insight into the data privacy or security practices of third-party service providers. Our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and they may not have adequate information security measures in place. If one of our third-party suppliers suffers a security breach or incident, our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct access to their systems, logs and other information related to the security breach or incident. 
Interruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business. We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business. Any significant system or network disruption, including but not limited to new system implementations, faulty software provided by one of our security vendors, computer viruses, security breaches or incidents, or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations, sales and operating results. We have implemented measures to manage our risks related to such disruptions, but such disruptions could still occur and negatively impact our operations and financial results. Furthermore, the risk of state-supported and geopolitically motivated cybersecurity incidents may increase due to geopolitical instability. In addition, we may incur additional costs to remedy any damages caused by these disruptions, security breaches or other security incidents.
Intense competition in the high-voltage power supply industry may lead to a decrease in our average selling price and reduced sales volume of our products. The high-voltage power supply industry is intensely competitive and characterized by significant price sensitivity. Our products face competition from alternative technologies, such as linear transformers, discrete switcher power supplies, and other integrated and hybrid solutions. If the price of competing solutions decreases significantly, the cost effectiveness of our products will be adversely affected. If power requirements for applications in which our products are currently utilized go outside the cost-effective range of our products, some of these alternative technologies can be used more cost effectively. In addition, as our patents expire, our competitors could legally begin using the technology covered by the expired patents in their products, potentially increasing the performance of their products and/or decreasing the cost of their products, which may enable our competitors to compete more effectively. Our current patents may or may not inhibit our competitors from getting any benefit from an expired patent. 
Additionally, we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies, many of which have greater market recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution and other resources than we do. In addition, some governments, such as China, may provide, or have provided and may continue to provide, significant assistance financial or otherwise, to some of our competitors, or to new entrants, and may intervene in support of national industries and/or competitors, including to try to disrupt the U.S. semiconductor industry. The semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation in recent years which has resulted in several of our competitors becoming much larger in terms of revenue, product offerings and scale. We may be unable to compete successfully in the future, which could harm our business. 
We have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, competitive pricing pressures on our products. We may be unable to maintain average selling prices due to increased pricing pressure, including as a result of actions taken by foreign governments such as China to favor companies located in their own country, which could adversely impact our operating results.
We, and our competitors, seek to improve yields, which could result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor products, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, could lead to declines in average selling prices for our products, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
We depend on third-party suppliers to provide us with wafers for our products and if they fail to provide us sufficient quantities of wafers, our business may suffer. Our primary supply arrangements for the production of wafers are with Epson, Lapis and X-FAB. Our contracts with these suppliers expire on varying dates, with Lapis and X-FAB each to expire in December 2028 and Epson to expire in December 2035. Although some aspects of our relationships with Lapis, X-FAB and Epson are contractual, many important aspects of these relationships depend on their continued cooperation. We cannot assure that we will continue to work successfully with Epson, Lapis and X-FAB in the future, and that the wafer foundries’ capacity will meet our needs. Additionally, one or more of these wafer foundries could seek an early termination of our wafer supply agreements. Any serious disruption in the supply of wafers from Epson, Lapis and X-FAB could harm our business. We estimate that it would take 12 to 24 months from the time we identified an alternate manufacturing source to produce wafers with acceptable manufacturing yields in sufficient quantities to meet our needs.

18




Although we provide our foundries with rolling forecasts of our production requirements, their ability to provide wafers to us is ultimately limited by the available capacity of the wafer foundry. Any reduction in wafer foundry capacity available to us could require us to pay amounts in excess of contracted or anticipated amounts for wafer deliveries or require us to make other concessions to meet our customers’ requirements or may limit our ability to meet demand for our products. Further, to the extent demand for our products exceeds wafer foundry capacity, this could inhibit us from expanding our business and harm relationships with our customers. Any of these concessions or limitations could harm our business.
If our third-party suppliers and independent subcontractors do not produce our wafers and assemble our finished products at acceptable yields, our net revenue may decline. We depend on independent foundries to produce wafers, and independent subcontractors to assemble and test finished products, at acceptable yields and to deliver them to us in a timely manner. The failure of the foundries to supply us wafers at acceptable yields could prevent us from selling our products to our customers and would likely cause a decline in our net revenue and gross margin. In addition, our IC assembly process requires our manufacturers to use a high-voltage molding compound that has been available from only a few suppliers. These compounds and their specified processing conditions require a more exacting level of process control than normally required for standard IC packages. Unavailability of assembly materials or problems with the assembly process can materially and adversely affect yields, timely delivery and cost to manufacture. We may not be able to maintain acceptable yields in the future.
In addition, if prices for commodities used in our products increase significantly, raw material costs would increase for our suppliers which could result in an increase in the prices our suppliers charge us. To the extent we are not able to pass these costs on to our customers; this would have an adverse effect on our gross margins.
Additionally, certain materials are primarily available in a limited number of countries, including rare earth elements, minerals, and metals. Trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, economic circumstances, transit disruptions, political conditions, or public health issues, may limit our ability to obtain materials or equipment. Although rare earth and other materials are generally available from multiple suppliers, China is the predominant producer of certain of these materials. If China were to restrict or stop exporting these materials, our suppliers' ability to obtain such supply may be constrained and we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities, or obtain supply in a timely manner, or at a commercially reasonable cost. Constrained supply of rare earth elements, minerals, and metals may restrict our ability to manufacture certain of our products and make it difficult or impossible to compete with other semiconductor memory manufacturers who are able to obtain sufficient quantities of these materials from China or other countries.
We must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful and competition for qualified personnel is intense in our market. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, such as experienced analog design engineers and systems applications engineers. The competition for these employees is intense, particularly in Silicon Valley. The loss of the services of one or more of our engineers, executive officers or other key personnel could harm our business. In addition, if qualified personnel leave our employ, and we are unable to quickly and efficiently replace those individuals with qualified personnel who can smoothly transition into their new roles, our business may suffer. We do not have long-term employment contracts with, and we do not have in place key person life insurance policies on, any of our employees.
Changes in our management team can also disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations, given the lengthy sales cycle for our products and the large capital investments over a long time period required for our operations. We have had a number of changes in our senior leadership team in recent years, including, for example, the retirement of our former chief executive officer and the departure of our former chief financial officer in 2025. To the extent we do not effectively hire, onboard, retain, and motivate key employees and leadership, our business may be harmed.
We may incur higher than expected expenses or not realize the expected benefits, or any benefits, of restructuring initiatives designed to reduce costs and create a more efficient organization. We have pursued in the past and may pursue in the future restructuring initiatives designed to reduce costs and create a more efficient organization to support our business, including reductions in our workforce or relocating certain operations. Any restructuring initiatives could result in potential adverse effects on employee capabilities; our continued ability to recruit, hire, retain and motivate highly skilled personnel; our ability to maintain and grow our customer base; or our ability to effectively operate other aspects of our business. Adverse effects of our restructuring activities could lead to additional costs, harm our efficiency or impact our ability to effectively operate our business. In addition, we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to realign our organizational structure and shift our investments. The potential negative impact of restructuring efforts on our business may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

19




Because the sales cycle for our products can be lengthy, we may incur substantial expenses before we generate significant revenue, if any. Our products are generally incorporated into a customer’s products at the design stage. However, customer decisions to use our products, commonly referred to as design wins, can often require us to expend significant research and development and sales and marketing resources without any assurance of success. These significant research and development and sales and marketing resources often precede volume sales, if any, by a year or more. The value of any design win will largely depend upon the commercial success of the customer’s product. We cannot assure that we will continue to achieve design wins or that any design win will result in future revenue. If a customer decides at the design stage not to incorporate our products into its product, we may not have another opportunity for a design win with respect to that product for many months or years.
The power supply industry routinely experiences cyclical market patterns and our products are used across different end markets. A significant downturn in the industry or in any of these end markets could cause a meaningful reduction in demand for our products and adversely affect our operating results. The power supply industry is highly cyclical and subject to downturns, such as we have recently seen, and our revenue and gross margin can fluctuate significantly due to such downturns. These downturns can be severe and prolonged and can result in price erosion and weak demand for our products. Weak demand for our products resulting from general economic conditions affecting the end markets we serve, or the power supply industry specifically, and reduced spending by our customers can result, and in the past has resulted, in diminished product demand, high inventory levels, erosion of average selling prices, excess and obsolete inventories and corresponding inventory write-downs. Our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations of future sales. Many of our expenses, particularly those relating to facilities, capital equipment, and other overhead, are relatively fixed. We might be unable to reduce spending quickly enough to compensate for reductions in sales. Accordingly, shortfalls in sales could adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, any significant upturn in the power supply industry could result in increased competition for access to raw materials and third-party service providers.
Additionally, our products are used across different end markets, and demand for our products is difficult to predict and may vary within or among our end markets. Our target markets may not grow or develop as we currently expect, and demand may increase or change in one or more of our end markets, and changes in demand may reduce our revenue, lower our gross margin and effect our operating results. Any deterioration in these end markets, reductions in the magnitude of revenue streams, our inability to meet design and pricing requirements, or volatility in demand for our products could lead to a reduction in our revenue and adversely affect our operating results. Our success in our end markets depends on many factors, including the strength or financial performance of the customers in our end markets, our ability to timely meet rapidly changing product requirements, market needs, and our ability to maintain design wins across different markets and customers to dampen the effects of market volatility. The dynamics of the markets in which we operate make prediction of and timely reaction to such events difficult.
In addition, expectations and front-loaded investment related to AI may increase the magnitude and volatility of industry cycles, making downturns more abrupt or recoveries more uneven. Recent industry investment and customer spending patterns have been influenced by heightened interest in AI and AI-related applications. To the extent that current levels of investment in AI-related infrastructure, products, or end-market demand reflect expectations that are not ultimately realized, or if customer spending related to AI moderates, is delayed, or declines more rapidly than anticipated, the industry could experience an accelerated or more pronounced downturn.
Due to these and other factors, our past results may not be reliable predictors of our future results. If we are unable to accomplish any of the foregoing, or to offset the volatility of cyclical changes in the power supply industry or our end markets through diversification into other markets, these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.
In the event of an earthquake, fire, other pandemics, natural or other disasters, including with respect to climate change, our operations may be interrupted and our business would be harmed. Our principal executive offices and operating facilities are situated near San Francisco, California, and most of our major suppliers, which are wafer foundries and assembly houses, are located in areas that have been subject to severe earthquakes, such as Japan. Many of our suppliers are also susceptible to other disasters such as tropical storms, typhoons, tsunamis or other catastrophic events, including those caused by climate change. In the event of a disaster, we or one or more of our major suppliers may be temporarily unable to continue operations and may suffer significant property damage. Additionally, our business or the business of our suppliers may in the future be adversely impacted by world-wide responses to any global health or other crises. Such impacts could include public health measures, travel restrictions, business shutdowns, border closures, delivery and freight delays and other disruptions. Any interruption in our ability, or that of our major suppliers, to continue operations could delay the development and shipment of our products and have a substantial negative impact on our financial results.

Risks Related to Financial Performance
Our products are sold through distributors, which limits our direct interaction with our end customers, therefore reducing our ability to forecast sales and increasing the complexity of our business. Sales to distributors account for a significant portion of our net revenue. Selling through distributors reduces our ability to forecast sales and creates challenges for our business by requiring us, among other things, to:

●   manage a more complex supply chain;
---------------------------------------

●   monitor the level of inventory of our products at each distributor, and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

●   monitor the financial condition and credit-worthiness of our distributors, many of which are located outside of the United States and are not publicly traded.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since we have limited ability to forecast inventory levels at our end customers, it is possible that there may be significant build-up of inventories in the distributor channel, with the OEM or the OEM’s contract manufacturer. Such a buildup could result in a slowdown in orders, requests for returns from customers, or requests to move out planned shipments. This could adversely impact our revenue and profits. Any failure to manage these complexities could disrupt or reduce sales of our products and unfavorably impact our financial results.
In addition, to the extent we are not able to keep our products away from unintended markets, demand and pricing dynamics can become distorted in our distributor channel and certain geographies, which could adversely affect our revenue. Further, customers purchasing our products on unintended markets may use our products for purposes for which they were not intended, or may purchase counterfeit or substandard products, for instance that have been altered or damaged, which could harm our business and cause our reputation to be adversely affected. 
Fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen, Swiss franc and euro, may impact our gross margin and net income. Our exchange rate risk related to the Japanese yen includes two of our major suppliers, Epson and Lapis, with which we have wafer supply agreements based in U.S. dollars; however, these agreements also allow for mutual sharing of the impact of the exchange rate fluctuation between Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar. Each year, our management and these suppliers review and negotiate pricing; the negotiated pricing is denominated in U.S. dollars but is subject to contractual exchange rate provisions. The fluctuation in the exchange rate is shared equally between Power Integrations and each of these suppliers. We maintain cash denominated in Swiss francs and euros to fund the operations of our Swiss subsidiary. The functional currency of our Swiss subsidiary is the U.S. dollar; gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of non-functional currency balances are recorded in other income in our consolidated statements of income, and material unfavorable exchange-rate fluctuations with the Swiss franc could negatively impact our net income.
If we are unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we could lose market share, incur costly litigation expenses, suffer incremental price erosion or lose valuable assets, any of which could harm our operations and negatively impact our profitability. Our success depends upon our ability to continue our technological innovation and protect our intellectual property, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and know-how. We cannot assure that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation, or that others will not develop competitive technologies or products. From time to time, we have received, and we may receive in the future, communications alleging possible infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Costly litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claimed infringement. The failure to obtain necessary licenses and other rights, and/or litigation arising out of infringement claims could cause us to lose market share and harm our business.
Our U.S. patents have expiration dates ranging from 2026 to 2046. We cannot assure that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market. We believe our failure to compete successfully in the high-voltage power supply business, including our ability to introduce new products with higher average selling prices, would materially harm our operating results. As our patents expire, we will lose intellectual property protection previously afforded by those patents. Additionally, the laws of some foreign countries in which our technology is or may in the future be licensed may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, thus limiting the protections applicable to our technology.
If we do not prevail in our litigation, we will have expended significant financial resources, potentially without any benefit, and may also suffer the loss of rights to use some technologies. We are currently involved in defending a patent litigation matter and the outcome of the litigation is uncertain. See Note 14, Legal Proceedings and Contingencies, in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  In the event of an 

21




adverse outcome, we may be required to pay substantial damages, stop our manufacture, use, sale, or importation of infringing products, or obtain licenses to the intellectual property found to have been infringed. We have also incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant legal costs in conducting these lawsuits, including the appeals of the case we are defending, and our involvement in this litigation and any future intellectual property litigation could adversely affect sales and divert the efforts and attention of our technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor. Thus, even if we are successful in these lawsuits, the benefits of this success may fail to outweigh the significant legal costs we will have incurred.
Risks Related to Laws and Regulations
Changes in tax rules and regulations, changes in interpretation of tax rules and regulations, or unfavorable assessments from tax audits may increase the amount of taxes we are required to pay. Our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the United States and in multiple foreign jurisdictions and to review or audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and state, local and foreign tax authorities. In addition, the United States, countries in Asia and other countries where we do business have recently enacted or are considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to multinational companies. For example, on July 4, 2025, the United States enacted federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act”, which, among other changes, allows domestic research and development expenditures to be expensed for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2025 and modifies certain international tax provisions for tax years starting on or after January 1, 2026. This legislation or other potential changes could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us.
The EU member states formally adopted the EU’s Pillar Two Directive, which was established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the “OECD”), and which generally provides for a 15 per cent minimum effective tax rate for multinational corporations, in all jurisdictions in which they operate (“Pillar Two”). However, on January 5, 2026, the OECD announced a “side-by-side” elective safe harbor that exempts U.S.-parented multinational corporations from certain provisions of Pillar Two for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2026.
The foregoing items could have a material effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions. 
Changes in environmental laws and regulations, including with respect to energy consumption and climate change, may have a negative impact on our business. Changing environmental regulations and the timetable to implement them continue to impact our customers’ demand for our products. Currently we have limited visibility into our customers’ strategies to implement these changing environmental regulations into their business. The inability to accurately determine our customers’ strategies could increase our inventory costs related to obsolescence.
The semiconductor industry is subject to environmental regulations, particularly those that control and restrict the sourcing, use, transportation, storage, and disposal of certain mineral, chemicals, and materials used in the semiconductor manufacturing process. We expect the heightened worldwide awareness regarding climate change and the environmental impact to continue, which may result in new environmental laws and regulations that could affect us, our suppliers and/or our customers. New environmental laws and regulations could require us or our suppliers to obtain alternative materials that may increase our costs more or be less available, which may adversely affect our operating results.
Additionally, the heightened worldwide awareness regarding climate change could also result in risks such as shifting customer preferences. Changing customer preferences may result in increased expectations regarding our solutions, products, and services, including the use of packaging materials and other components in our products and their environmental impact. These expectations may cause us to incur additional costs or make other changes to our operations to respond to them, which could adversely affect our financial results. If we fail to manage transition risks and customer expectations in an effective manner, customer demand for our solutions, products, and services could diminish, and our profitability could suffer. Concerns over climate change, as well as the adoption of new laws or regulations, may also impact market dynamics and may result in shifts in customer expectations, preferences, or requirements, which may require us to change our practices or incur increased costs or adversely impact customer demand for our products and services.
General Risk Factors
Current or potential war, domestic or international conflict, political or social instability, or military actions could adversely affect our business. Like other U.S. companies, our business and operating results are subject to uncertainties arising out of economic consequences of current and potential military actions or terrorist activities and associated political instability, and the impact of heightened security concerns on domestic and international travel and 

22




commerce. These uncertainties could also lead to delays or cancellations of customer orders, a general decrease in corporate spending or our inability to effectively market and sell our products. Any of these results could substantially harm our business and results of operations, causing a decrease in our revenue.
We are exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and strategic investments. We have made, and in the future intend to make, acquisitions of, and investments in, companies, technologies or products in existing, related or new markets. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including but not limited to:

●   inability to realize anticipated benefits, which may occur due to any of the reasons described below, or for other unanticipated reasons;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

●   the risk of litigation or disputes with customers, suppliers, partners or stockholders of an acquisition target arising from a proposed or completed transaction;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

●   impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance, which would adversely affect our financial results; and
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

●   unknown, underestimated and/or undisclosed commitments, liabilities or issues not discovered in our due diligence of such transactions.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We also in the future may have strategic relationships with other companies, which may decline in value and/or not meet desired objectives. The success of these strategic relationships depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control and requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners. Moreover, these relationships are often illiquid, such that it may be difficult or impossible for us to monetize such relationships.
Our inability to successfully integrate, or realize the expected benefits from, our acquisitions could adversely affect our results. We have made, and in the future intend to make, acquisitions of other businesses and with these acquisitions there is a risk that integration difficulties may cause us not to realize expected benefits. The success of the acquisitions could depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings (if any) from combining the businesses of the acquired companies and our business, which may take longer to realize than expected.
Securities laws and regulations, including potential risk resulting from our evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting, will continue to impact our results. Complying with the requirements of the federal securities laws, state laws, stock exchange requirements, and other legal requirements has imposed significant legal and financial compliance costs, and are expected to continue to impose significant costs and management burden on us. These rules and regulations also may make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and members of our board of directors, particularly qualified members to serve on our audit committee. 
Additionally, because these laws, regulations and standards are expected to be subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices.
​
We have been and may be subject to or involved in litigation, threatened litigation or other disputes, the outcome of which may be difficult to predict, and which may be costly to defend, divert management attention, require us to pay damages or other payments, or restrict the operation of our business. From time to time, we have been and may be subject to disputes and litigation, with and without merit, that may be costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general. Such disputes and litigation are various and may include, but are not limited to, indemnification claims, claims of alleged infringement of patents, trademarks, copyrights and other IP rights, claims of alleged non-compliance with contract provisions and claims related to alleged violations of laws and regulations. The results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. Moreover, complaints filed against us may not specify the amount of damages that plaintiffs seek, and we therefore may be unable to estimate the possible range of damages that might be incurred should these lawsuits be resolved against us. Even if we are able to estimate losses related to these actions, the ultimate amount of loss may be materially higher than our estimates. Any resolution of litigation, threatened litigation, or other disputes, could involve the payment of damages, payments or expenses by us, which may be significant or involve an agreement with terms that restrict the operation of our business. Even if any future lawsuits are not resolved against us, the costs of defending such lawsuits may be significant. It is possible that we will not be able to obtain insurance coverage for our litigation and disputes in the amounts and for the risks we seek at policy costs and terms we desire. 

23




Allegations made in the course of legal proceedings may also harm our reputation, regardless of whether there is merit to such claims. We can provide no assurance that additional litigation will not be filed against us in the future. The impacts of litigation, threatened litigation or other disputes could be harmful to our business and results of operations.
