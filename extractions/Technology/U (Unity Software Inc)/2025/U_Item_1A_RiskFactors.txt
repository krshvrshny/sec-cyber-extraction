Item 1A. Risk Factors

Risks Related to Our Business, Operations, and Industry

We have a history of losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability on a GAAP basis in the future.

We have experienced significant net losses on a GAAP basis in each period since inception. In addition, our revenue has varied and, in certain periods, declined and could vary or decline in the future. We are not certain whether we will achieve or maintain profitability in the future. Our costs and expenses may increase in the long term on a GAAP basis, which could negatively affect our future results of operations. In addition, our investments in areas such as:

•research and development, including investments in our engineering teams and in further differentiating our platform, as well as the development of new solutions and features;

•our sales and marketing organizations to engage our existing and prospective customers, increase brand awareness and drive adoption and expansion of our platform and solutions;

•initiatives to grow our presence in new or adjacent industries and use cases beyond the gaming industry;

•our technology infrastructure, including systems architecture, hosting, scalability, availability, performance, and security;

•acquisitions or strategic investments;

•global expansion or restructuring; and

•our general and administration organization, including legal, IT, and accounting expenses,

will vary from period to period, which will impact our costs and ability to achieve and maintain profitability.

Even if such investments increase our revenue, any such increase may not be enough to offset any increase in operating expenses. Cost-cutting efforts, such as discontinuing certain product offerings, reducing our workforce or reducing our office footprint, may not be effective or may not be effective on the timelines or to the extent we expect.

Our past results may not be indicative of future operating performance.

You should not rely on our past results of operations as indicators of future performance. Overall growth of our revenue is difficult to predict and depends, in part, on our ability to execute on enhancing our artificial intelligence (“AI”) capabilities and data infrastructure, our ongoing business realignment, and other growth strategies. You should evaluate our prospects in light of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by growing companies in rapidly evolving markets. These risks and uncertainties include challenges in accurate financial planning as a result of limited historical data relevant to the current scale and scope of our business and the recent changes to our business and operating model.

If we are not able to grow efficiently, and manage our costs, we may not achieve profitability on a GAAP basis.

We aim to achieve and maintain profitability on a GAAP basis. To do so, we need to continuously improve our platform’s capabilities, features and functionality. In addition, we will need to appropriately scale our internal business, IT, and financial, operating and administrative systems to serve our growing customer base, while continuing to manage headcount, capital and operating and reporting processes and expenses in an efficient manner. Any failure of, or delay in, these efforts could result in impaired performance, reduced customer satisfaction and decreased sales to new customers, which would hurt our revenue growth and our reputation. In addition, costs associated with our third-party cloud service providers represent a significant portion of our ongoing expenses, and any failure to manage or optimize those costs or commitments could negatively impact our gross margins. Even if we are successful in our 

Unity Software Inc.

efforts to grow and expand, such efforts will be expensive and complex, and require the dedication of significant management time and attention. We may also suffer inefficiencies or service disruptions as a result of our efforts to scale our internal infrastructure. Cost-cutting interventions and improvements to our internal infrastructure to offset expenses may not be effectively or timely implemented, and such failures could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

If we fail to timely release updates and new features to our platform, develop successful new products, or adapt and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology, or to changing customer needs, requirements, or preferences, our platform may become less competitive.

The markets in which we operate are subject to rapid technological change, changing customer needs, requirements and preferences, and are highly competitive. The success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to adapt and respond effectively to these changes and competitive pressures on a timely basis. For example, in the first quarter of 2025 we rolled out our new machine learning model, Unity Vector, in our Grow Solutions business. If we do not continue to improve our AI capabilities and data infrastructure, including Unity Vector, on a timely basis or at all, our business could be harmed. Similarly, emerging technologies like AI are likely to impact the way that customers utilize our solutions, as well as enhance the functionality of our solutions. Accordingly, our ability to retain and expand within our existing customers and attract new ones, and increase our revenue, depends in large part on our ability to maintain, improve and differentiate our existing platform and introduce new functionality promptly and effectively, as well as developing successful new product offerings. Revenue growth from our offerings also depends on our ability to continue to respond to advancements in competing technologies, and end-user demands and expectations, which will require us to incur additional costs to implement. If we do not continue to improve our platform with additional features and functionality in a timely fashion, or if intended improvements to our platform are ineffective or otherwise not well received by customers, our revenue could be adversely affected.

If we fail to deliver timely releases of our solutions that are ready for commercial use, we release a version, service, tool or update with a material vulnerability, or other error, or we are unable to enhance our platform to keep pace with rapid technological changes or respond to new offerings by our competitors, or if new technologies emerge that are able to deliver competitive solutions at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently or more securely than our solutions, or if new operating systems, gaming platforms or devices are developed and we are unable to support our customers' deployment of games and other applications onto those systems, platforms or devices, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We are increasingly building AI into certain of our offerings, and issues raised by the use of, or failure to successfully use, AI in our offerings, or the use of AI by our customers and competitors may adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.

We are increasingly building AI into certain of our offerings, such as Unity Vector, our new machine learning model, our new Unity AI product line, which includes AI Assistant and AI Generators, which are currently in beta, and Unity Inference Engine (formerly Unity Sentis), which allows creators to embed an AI model in the Unity Runtime for their game or application, enhancing gameplay and other functionality. AI Generators leverage both Unity-developed and third-party models for AI-driven assistance during creation. With respect to third-party models, we do not control the data used to train such models or the specific outputs they generate; we act as a conduit for customer requests and return the responses from those third-party models. The datasets used to train third-party models may inadvertently include content that infringes intellectual property rights. Because we do not control the training data or model weights of third-party models, we may be subject to liability or reputational harm if customers use outputs generated through our offerings that are alleged to infringe third-party intellectual property rights. Unity-developed models are trained exclusively on directly-licensed or open-licensed data; however, we rely on the accuracy and scope of those licenses as represented by the licensors, and if such representations are incorrect or incomplete, we could face claims that our training data included content used without proper authorization. The outputs of both Unity-developed and third-party models may also inadvertently replicate protected content, resulting in potential claims of infringement. We continue to advance machine

learning ("ML") algorithms in our Grow Solutions, which are designed to enable us to provide customers with better performance. AI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant competition from other companies as well as an evolving regulatory landscape. AI technologies, in particular generative AI and interactive chatbots, are subject to existing laws of various states and countries such as those regarding privacy, data security, and consumer protection, and the evolving regulatory landscape and our product development efforts may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, ethical concerns, or other complications that could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results. AI technologies, including generative AI and interactive chatbots, are subject to existing laws of various states and countries such as those regarding privacy, data security, and consumer protection. In particular, global AI regulatory frameworks remain highly uncertain, rapidly changing, and inconsistent across jurisdictions, and frequently have extraterritorial reach, and, as a result may apply to our AI offerings regardless of where they are developed or deployed. For example, the EU AI Act sets out a risk-based framework, subjecting certain AI technologies to numerous compliance obligations, including transparency, conformity and risk assessment, monitoring and human oversight requirements, and noncompliance could lead to fines of up to 35 million Euros or 7% of our total worldwide annual turnover. Certain provisions of the EU AI Act could require us to alter or restrict our use of AI both in features or products available to our users and in our systems that interact with our users.  In addition, certain U.S. states have proposed, enacted, or are considering laws governing the development and use of AI technologies, such as the Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act, California Bot Disclosure Law, the Utah Artificial Intelligence Policy Act, and the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") regulations on automated decision-making technology.

Additionally, certain privacy and data security laws extend rights to consumers and regulate automated decision making in ways that may be incompatible with our use of AI/ML. These obligations may make it harder for us to conduct our business using AI/ML, lead to litigation or regulatory fines or penalties, require us to change our business practices, retrain our AI/ML, delete our models, or prevent or limit our use of AI/ML. For example, the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") has required other companies to delete algorithms and models derived from or trained on allegedly unlawfully collected data, where it has alleged the company has violated privacy or consumer protection laws.

Governments are increasingly scrutinizing generative AI technologies for potential intellectual property and content-related harms, and any regulatory enforcement or litigation in this area could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results. In addition, AI and ML models may create flawed, incomplete, or inaccurate outputs, some of which may appear correct. This may happen if the inputs that the model relied on were inaccurate, incomplete or flawed (including if a bad actor "poisons" the AI/ML with bad inputs or logic), or if the logic of the AI/ML is flawed (a so-called "hallucination"). We may use AI/ML outputs to make certain decisions. Due to these potential inaccuracies or flaws, the model could lead us to make decisions that could bias certain individuals or classes of individuals and adversely impact their rights. Our AI-enabled technology could be used by an end user in a manner publicly perceived as controversial. The foregoing can cause us to face adverse consequences, including reputational harm, competitive harm, customer loss or legal liability.

 As these requirements continue to emerge or change, we may be required to modify, restrict, or disable certain AI features; implement new technical, governance and other controls; or incur significant compliance and operational costs. Failure to anticipate or comply with evolving AI regulatory obligations could adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver AI-enabled offerings, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or negatively impact our business, reputation, or financial results.

The increasing use of AI and ML, including AI-driven automation tools, may enable customers to reduce their reliance on human developers, and therefore paid seat licenses, or otherwise circumvent usage- and seat-based licensing metrics by obfuscating the number of users accessing our products. Any such shift could materially reduce demand for our core subscription-based products and adversely affect our revenues and business model.

Advances in AI and 2D and 3D content generation technologies may enable our customers to use AI to automate or replicate aspects of content, content creation, simulation, or runtime functionality

provided by our platform and solutions, and allow competitors to develop solutions that reduce the competitiveness of our platform and solutions. Even where such activities are unauthorized or prohibited, our ability to prevent, detect, or stop it may be limited. To the extent such advances reduce the need for our products, or otherwise disintermediate Unity from the content creation process, our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

Market acceptance of AI technologies is uncertain, and we may allocate resources toward technologies or products that do not align with customer needs or achieve market acceptance, or are rapidly rendered obsolete. We may be unsuccessful in product development efforts, or our competitors may use AI technologies more efficiently than we do and develop solutions that reduce the competitiveness of our product offerings. We may also incur significant costs and may not achieve any significant revenue from these new offerings. The performance or suitability of third-party models could change in ways that negatively affect the customer experience, and our reliance on third-party models may also limit our ability to differentiate our offerings or control cost and performance characteristics. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.

If we are unable to retain our existing customers and expand their use of our platform, or attract new customers, our growth and operating results could be adversely affected, and we may be required to reconsider our growth strategy.

Our future success depends on our ability to retain our existing customers, expand their use of our platform and attract new customers. Our marketing efforts may not be successful despite the resources we devote to them.

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from our Grow Solutions, which is primarily generated under revenue-share or profit-share models. Under these models, our customers depend on us as a source of their own revenue, which in some cases may represent a significant portion of their total revenue. Should customers lose confidence in the value or effectiveness of our Grow Solutions, consumption of these offerings could decline.

Our Grow Solutions customers rely on us to attract a broad range of advertisers to our platform to generate demand for their impressions through our offerings, including Unity Ads. If we are unable to also serve the needs of advertisers, they may reduce their consumption of our solutions and shift their business to other competitor advertising solutions or supply paths, which could adversely affect our revenue. In addition, advertising spending is often adversely affected by macroeconomic factors like economic downturns and inflation. These factors have in the past decreased, and may in the future decrease or halt, advertiser spending. Our Grow Solutions are also dependent upon the continued proliferation of connected devices, such as smartphones, tablets and televisions, as well as the increased consumption of content through those devices. Consumer usage of these devices may be inhibited for a number of reasons beyond our control. If user adoption of connected devices or user consumption of content on those devices do not continue to grow, our business could be harmed.

For us to maintain or improve our results of operations, it is important that our customers continue using and expanding their use of our solutions. Create Solutions customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions, which are primarily for one to five years in length, after they expire, and our Grow Solutions, which are primarily sold under revenue-share or profit-share-based models. We invest in targeted sales and account-based marketing efforts to identify opportunities to grow use of our solutions within and across multiple studios within a single customer. However, our efforts may not be successful despite the resources we devote to them. Even if one or several studios within a customer adopt our Create or Grow Solutions, other studios within that customer may choose to adopt different solutions or to continue to employ internally-developed solutions. Further, consolidation or reorganization of studios within a customer may reduce opportunities to expand usage of our solutions across multiple studios. In addition, we periodically review our fees, pricing structures and business models, and decisions to change how we price our products or services have been and may in the future be viewed unfavorably and harm our business.

Unity Software Inc.

It is also important for us to cross-sell more Create Solutions to our Grow Solutions customers and vice versa. While we believe there are significant benefits to our customers in using both our Create and Grow Solutions, our Create Solutions customers are under no obligation to use our Grow Solutions, and our efforts to cross-sell may not be successful.

If we fail to successfully execute our plans to reset our portfolio to focus on our Strategic Portfolio and to right-size our investments, our business will be harmed.

We have realigned our business to focus on the Unity Engine and related consumption services, and monetization solutions, and are continuing to exit other businesses and right-size our investments. These efforts may not be effective or sufficient to offset our expenses, and may themselves have adverse impacts, such as loss of continuity or accumulated knowledge, limited technological support on legacy products, inefficiency during transitional periods, distraction, and potential challenges operating our business with fewer resources. For example, in 2024 we reduced our employee workforce by approximately 25%, and various members of our management team departed from their operational roles and in 2025 we further reduced our employee workforce and continued to wind down certain non-strategic businesses. The departure of employees may create a loss of accumulated knowledge, inefficiency, and other challenges to operating our business. If we fail to efficiently execute on these plans to restructure, or if the benefits from these efforts are not achieved on the timeline or to the extent we expect, our business may be harmed and we may fail to achieve or maintain profitability.

The markets in which we participate are highly competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.

The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Specifically, we have faced and may continue to face competition as a result of:

•rapid technological change, such as the rise of AI, and machine learning and increasing use of data and trained models as well as changing customer needs, requirements and preferences;

•the impact of evolving industry standards and changing regulations, which may affect us differently than some our competitors, including, for example, increased costs for advertisers to target users due to changes in the data privacy landscape; 

•reduced supply from game publishers, who may also use channels beyond in-app advertising to grow revenue;

•the development of alternative solutions by a significant number of companies, including other gaming and ad-tech companies;

•lower prices or free solutions offered by our competitors, some of whom may offer more favorable payment terms to publishers;

•the introduction of alternative solutions by larger, more experienced companies that offer 2D and 3D design solutions in the industries in which we currently operate or may expand into; and

•mergers, acquisitions and other strategic relationships amongst our competitors which may allow them to provide more comprehensive offerings or achieve greater economies of scale than us, and which may introduce new competitors in our markets.

Our competitors include other game development engines and platforms and large technology and ad-tech companies, many of which have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more established customer relationships, larger marketing budgets and greater financial and operational resources than we do. We cannot assure you that we will not be forced to engage in price-cutting or revenue limiting initiatives, change payment terms or increase our advertising and other expenses to attract and retain customers in response to competitive pressures.

Unity Software Inc.

In addition, some of our competitors are also our partners and/or customers. We compete to various degrees on the basis of price, technical performance, product features, system compatibility, quality and sales and technical support. These competitors may decide to stop buying our products, compete more aggressively with us, use technical capabilities to hinder the performance of our products, or use our products or the information they obtain about or derived from our products and technology to develop or improve their own competing solutions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

If we are unable to compete successfully against our current or future competitors, it could result in the failure of our platform and products to continue to achieve or maintain market acceptance, which would harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

If we are unable to further expand into adjacent business areas or new industries, or if our solutions for any new business area or industry fail to achieve market acceptance, our growth and operating results could be adversely affected, and we may be required to reconsider our growth strategy.

Our growth strategy is based, in part, on expanding into new industries beyond gaming and adjacent product expansion. For example, the market for interactive RT3D and 2D content in industries beyond gaming is still developing, and it is uncertain whether this market will develop as we expect, how rapidly it will develop and how much it will grow. Our success in these markets will depend, to a substantial extent, on the widespread adoption of our products as an alternative to existing solutions, such as traditional 2D and 3D modeling and rendering tools, or adoption by customers that are not currently using any software solutions. Market acceptance of our platform in industries beyond gaming may not grow as we expect and if our platform does not achieve widespread adoption in these other markets, our ability to grow our revenue may suffer.

Similarly, the market for programmatic advertising and Connected TV ("CTV") solutions is highly competitive and evolving, and it is uncertain whether our expansion into these gaming-adjacent verticals will develop as we expect. Our success will depend on our ability to compete with incumbent demand-side and supply-side advertising platforms, as well as the widespread adoption of our advertising technology by agencies and brands that have historically relied on traditional media or closed digital ecosystems. Market acceptance of our solutions in these areas may be hindered by our ability to provide comparable scale, targeting, and transparent measurement relative to established competitors. If our programmatic and CTV offerings do not achieve widespread adoption, or if we are unable to effectively capture advertising spend from outside of our core gaming audience, our ability to grow our revenue and diversify our business may suffer.

We are also expanding our In-App Purchase ("IAP") solutions, designed to support developers across a variety of alternative payment processing and monetization platforms. The success of these offerings depends on our ability to maintain seamless technical integration with a variety of third-party payment service providers while ensuring compliance with the evolving requirements of major platform providers and complex regulatory requirements. Platform providers may introduce new fee structures or technical hurdles relating to external payment flows that increase friction for users, reduce conversion rates, and diminish the economic benefit of our IAP offering to our customers. If we cannot effectively manage these complexities, our ability to grow our payment processing-related revenue could be adversely affected.

The investments we make to expand into new or adjacent industries will continue to increase our costs and operating expenses on an absolute basis. We expect to invest in sales and marketing resources to develop and expand the use of our solutions by customers in these industries, and we will need to increase our sales and marketing, legal and compliance and other efforts as we seek to expand into additional industries that often require a different go-to-market strategy than the gaming industry. These investments may occur in advance of our realization of significant revenue from such industries, particularly in industries characterized by enterprise customers with long contracting cycles, which will make it difficult to determine if we are allocating our resources effectively and efficiently. If the revenue we 

9


Unity Software Inc.

derive from these investments is not sufficient to achieve a return on investment, our business and results of operations would suffer.

Our business relies in part on strategic relationships. If we are unable to maintain favorable terms and conditions and business relations with respect to our strategic relationships, our business could be harmed.

We rely in part on strategic partnerships and other strategic relationships with hardware, operating system, device, game console, and other technology providers in order to be able to offer our customers the ability to deploy their content on a variety of third-party platforms. If any of these third parties were to suspend, limit or cease their operations or otherwise terminate their relationships with us, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Our agreements with our strategic partners are non-exclusive and typically have multi-year terms. We may have disagreements or disputes with these parties that could negatively impact or threaten our relationship with them. We may not be successful in sourcing additional strategic partnerships or relationships or in retaining or extending our existing relationships with the parties with whom we currently have relationships, including as a result of acquisitions by competitors of our strategic partners or strategic partners themselves becoming competitors. If we are unable to source additional strategic relationships or the parties with whom we currently have strategic relationships were to terminate their relationship with us, our revenue could decline and our business could be adversely affected.

We are dependent on the success of our customers in the gaming market. Adverse events relating to our customers or their games could have a negative impact on our business.

Our gaming customers use our platform and solutions to create and/or operate their games, which are ultimately sold or distributed to an end user. As a result, our success depends in part on the ability of our customers to market and sell games that are created or operated with our solutions. If our customers' marketing efforts for their games are unsuccessful or if our customers experience a decrease in demand for their games, sales of our Create Solutions and our Grow Solutions could be reduced. The gaming market is characterized by intense competition, rapid technological change, increased focus by regulators, and economic uncertainty, and there is no guarantee that any of our customers' games will gain any meaningful traction with end users. While our large and diverse customer portfolio has helped to reduce the fluctuations in our Grow Solutions revenue as a whole resulting from the success of customers' games and the timing of game releases, we cannot assure you that the size and diversification of our customer portfolio will sufficiently mitigate this risk.

We may fail to realize the possible platform advantages between our Create and Grow Solutions, or those advantages may take longer to realize than expected.

We believe that there are significant benefits and advantages that may be realized through leveraging our Create and Grow Solutions. However, the efforts to realize these benefits and advantages is a complex process. The full benefits of these advantages may not be realized as expected or may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. In addition, we may incur additional or unexpected costs in order to leverage the advantages of being a single platform designed to deliver value to developers across the entire lifecycle. Failure to achieve these platform advantages could adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows, cause dilution to our earnings per share, and negatively impact our stock price.

Our results of operations have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future, making it difficult to project future results, and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors with respect to our results of operations, our stock price, and the value of your investment could decline.

Our results of operations have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, our past results may not be 

10


Unity Software Inc.

indicative of our future performance. In addition to the other risks described herein, factors that may affect our results of operations include the following:

•fluctuations in demand for, usage of, or pricing of our solutions;

•changes in the mix of solutions purchased by our customers;

•demand for our gaming customers' products and their ability to monetize those products, which in turn can have a significant impact on our revenue-share and consumption-based solutions;

•timing and amount of our investments to expand the capacity of our third-party cloud hosting providers;

•seasonality, especially with respect to our Grow Solutions, which tend to generate higher revenue during periods of increased time spent on entertainment, such as holidays;

•downturns or upturns in our sales which may not be immediately reflected in our financial position and results of operations;

•timing of customer budget cycles, purchases--including longer sales cycles for enterprise customers--and usage of our platform;

•market conditions and risks associated with the gaming industry, including the popularity, price and timing of release of games, changes in consumer demographics, the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment, public tastes and preferences;

•timing of updates and new features on our platform, or the release of new product offerings and our investments to support these features and offerings;

•fluctuations or delays in purchasing decisions by customers in anticipation of new solutions or enhancements by us or our competitors;

•amount and timing of payment for operating expenses, particularly research and development and sales and marketing expenses, including commissions, many of which occur in advance of the anticipated benefits resulting from such expenses;

•amount and timing of non-cash expenses, including stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and acquisition-related expenses;

•amount and timing of costs associated with recruiting, training and integrating new employees and retaining and motivating existing employees;

•timing of acquisitions and costs associated with integrating acquired companies;

•uncertain macroeconomic conditions, including changing international trade relations, as well as conditions specifically affecting industries in which our customers operate, which can impact customer spending and result in longer deal cycles;

•incorrect estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies;

•impact of new accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting principles;

•costs that we incur in order to comply with changing regulatory, tax or legal requirements, especially with respect to AI, privacy and security matters; and

•significant security breaches of, technical difficulties with or interruptions to the delivery and use of our platform.

Any of these and other factors, or the cumulative effect of some of these factors, may cause our results of operations to vary significantly. If our quarterly results of operations fall below the expectations of investors and securities analysts who follow our stock, the price of our common stock could decline substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.

Operating system platform providers or application stores may change terms of service, policies or technical requirements applicable to us or our customers, which could adversely impact our business.

We and our customers are subject to the standard policies and terms of service of the operating system platforms on which we create, run and monetize applications and content, as well as policies and terms of service of the various application stores, such as the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, which make our customers' applications and content available to end users. Each of these operating system platforms and stores has broad discretion to change and interpret its terms of service and policies. Each may also change its fee structure, add fees associated with access to and use of its platform, alter how customers are able to advertise or monetize on their platform, change how the personal or other user information is made available to application developers on their platform, limit the use of personal information for advertising purposes or restrict how end users can share information on their platform or across other platforms.

In particular, operating system platform providers or application stores such as Apple or Google have in the past and may in the future change their technical requirements or policies in a manner that adversely impacts the way in which we or our customers offer solutions or collect, use, and share data from end-user devices. Restrictions on our ability to offer solutions or collect and use data as desired could negatively impact our Create Solutions and Grow Solutions as well as our resource planning and feature development planning for our software. Changes to their technical requirements or policies may adversely impact solutions that we may offer including, for example, our IAP solution, and could lead to increased compliance costs, higher effective fee structures for our clients, or increased technical friction that could degrade the user experience and efficacy of our offerings, and ultimately harm our business.

If we or our customers violate, or are accused of violating, these terms of service or policies—which are frequently subject to change and lack clear or consistent interpretation by the platform providers—an operating system platform provider or application store could limit or discontinue our or our customers' access to its platform or store. Our business may also be harmed by inconsistent or non-uniform enforcement of these policies across our industry, which can create an unlevel playing field or sudden disruptions to our operations. Any limitation on or discontinuation of our or our customers' access to any third-party platform or application store could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

Furthermore, increased scrutiny of the industry by regulatory bodies may ultimately lead to more onerous regulatory frameworks (e.g., various upcoming application store accountability regulations) or fundamental shifts in how platform providers enforce their policies. For example, regulatory actions involving competitors regarding potential policy violations may increase the likelihood of platform-wide crackdowns or more restrictive terms of service that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

The actions of third parties with whom we do business may put our business and results of operations at risk.

We rely on third parties, including our strategic partners, for various aspects of our business, including deep technology collaborations, co-marketing, advertising partners, ad mediation services, ad attribution partners, development services agreements, and revenue share arrangements. Their actions may put our business, reputation, and brand at risk. In many cases, third parties may be given access to sensitive and proprietary information or personal information in order to provide services and support to our teams or customers, and they may misappropriate and engage in unauthorized use of our information, technology or customers' data. In addition, the failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies, or the failure of the third parties to adequately maintain or update their services and technologies, could result in a disruption to our business operations. For example, we rely on ad attribution partners to accurately and reliably perform mobile measurement and attribute ad impressions. Any failure of those services may result in a reduction in the number of ads attributed to our ad platform and a resulting reduction in our revenue and the revenue realized by our ad publishers. Further, disruptions in the mobile application industry, financial markets, economic downturns, poor 

12


Unity Software Inc.

business decisions, or reputational harm may adversely affect our partners and may increase their propensity to engage in fraud or otherwise illegal or improper activity which could harm our business reputation, and they may not be able to continue honoring their obligations to us, or we may cease our arrangements with them. Similarly, we rely on third-party mediation platforms, some of which operate or are affiliated with competing advertising networks, to access a significant amount of our advertising inventory. Alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all and we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner or vendor. If we lose one or more business relationships, or experience a degradation of services, our business could be harmed and our financial results could be adversely affected.

We use resellers and other third parties to sell, market, and deploy our solutions to a variety of customers, and our failure to effectively develop, manage, and maintain our indirect sales channels would harm our business.

We use resellers and other third parties to sell, market, and deploy our Create Solutions to a variety of customers, particularly in industries beyond gaming. For example, we currently leverage an indirect value-added reseller network to cost effectively service our mid-sized, small and independent Create Solutions customers and we engage in cooperative marketing efforts with strategic partners. Loss of or reduction in sales through these third parties could reduce our revenue. Identifying and retaining resellers and strategic partners, training them in our technology and solutions, and negotiating and documenting relationships with them, requires significant time and resources. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our relationships with our resellers or strategic partners on favorable terms or at all.

Our resellers may cease marketing or reselling our platform with limited or no notice and without penalty. Further, a substantial number of our agreements with resellers are non-exclusive such that those resellers may offer customers the solutions of several different companies, including solutions that compete with ours. Our resellers may favor our competitors' solutions or services over ours, including due to incentives that our competitors provide to resellers. One or more of our resellers could be acquired by one of our competitors, which could adversely affect our ability to sell through that reseller. If our resellers do not effectively sell, market or deploy our solutions, choose to promote our competitors' solutions, or otherwise fail to meet the needs of our customers, our ability to sell our solutions could be adversely affected.

Our direct sales force targets larger customers, and sales to these customers involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with respect to sales to smaller customers.

We utilize a direct sales organization to increase adoption within larger enterprise customers and to expand into new industries, where potential customers are typically larger organizations. The success of our Grow Solutions also depends in part on larger enterprise customers. Sales to larger customers involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with sales to smaller customers, such as longer sales cycles, more complex customer requirements, substantial upfront sales costs, and less predictability in completing some of our sales. If we do not effectively expand our direct sales or technical capabilities to address these industries effectively or develop effective sales and marketing strategies for those industries, or if we focus our efforts on non-gaming industries that end up being slow adopters of our platform and solutions, our ability to increase sales of our platform and solutions to industries and for use cases outside gaming will be adversely affected.

We provide service-level agreement commitments related to certain of our customers. If we fail to meet these contractual commitments, our business could be harmed.

Certain of our customers are entitled to service-level agreements commitments. If we are unable to meet the stated service-level commitments, including failure to meet the uptime and response time requirements under our customer agreements, we may be subject to significant financial and operational liabilities. Beyond the risk of contract terminations or suspensions, failures to meet these obligations may require us to provide service credits, refunds, or other remediation. In some instances, the cumulative cost of these remedies, combined with the operational resources required to remediate any underlying 

13


Unity Software Inc.

technical issues, could render specific customer deals or broader service offerings unprofitable. Any service-level failures could also damage our reputation, which could also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

If we fail to offer high-quality support, our ability to retain and attract customers could suffer.

Our customers rely on our sales, customer success and customer support personnel and tools to resolve issues and realize the full benefits that our platform provides. High-quality support is important for the retention of our existing customers and expanding their use of our platform. The importance of these functions will increase as we expand our business, pursue new customers, offer new products and seek to expand the use of our platform and solutions, including by enterprise customers in new industries outside of gaming. If we do not help our customers quickly resolve issues and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to maintain and expand our solution to existing and new customers could suffer, and our reputation with existing or potential customers could suffer.

Our business could be disrupted by catastrophic events, including natural disasters, health pandemics, militarization, or war.

Any catastrophic event, including earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power loss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunction, cyber-attack, war or terrorist attack, explosion, or pandemic could impact our business. In particular, our corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity, and are thus vulnerable to damage in an earthquake. Our insurance coverage may not compensate us for losses that may occur in the event of an earthquake or other significant natural disaster. If any disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our business at our facilities could be impaired and we could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations. If we are unable to develop adequate plans to ensure that our business functions continue to operate during and after a disaster and to execute successfully on those plans in the event of a disaster or emergency, our business would be harmed. In addition, certain of our operations or those of our customers could be impacted by militarization, war and other geopolitical disputes, including any renewal of the recent conflict in and around Israel, where we have a significant number of employees, any escalation of hostilities or conflict between China and Taiwan, which could adversely impact availability of computing components and resources, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and business condition.

Our current operations are and will continue to be global in scope, creating a variety of operational challenges.

We currently have operations and customers across all major global markets. We also have a sales presence in multiple countries. We expect that our global activities will continue to grow for the foreseeable future as we continue to pursue growth opportunities, which will require significant dedication of management attention and financial resources.

Our current and future global business and operations involve a variety of risks, including:

•slower than anticipated availability and adoption of our platform by creators outside the U.S., for example, in China where we experienced softness throughout 2023 and 2024;

•the need to adapt and localize our platform for specific countries;

•maintaining our company culture, which emphasizes developing and launching new and innovative solutions and which we believe is essential to our business, across all of our offices globally and requires aligning our values across cultures and viewpoints;

•difficulty collecting accounts receivable and potential for longer payment cycles, including due to disruptions or delays in global payment operations, and international payments or money transfers resulting from trade restrictions or sanctions or banking processes and procedures adopted in response;

•increased reliance on resellers and other third parties for our global expansion;

14


Unity Software Inc.

•burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, including costs associated with legal structures, accounting, statutory filings and tax liabilities;

•stringent and evolving regulations relating to privacy and data security and the unauthorized use of, or access to, commercial and personal information, particularly in Europe and China and certain U.S. states;

•differing and potentially more onerous labor regulations and practices, especially in Europe;

•challenges inherent in efficiently managing, and the increased costs associated with, having a geographically diverse workforce, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits, statutory equity requirements and compliance programs that are specific to each jurisdiction;

•changes in trade relations, particularly between the U.S. and China, regulations, laws or enforcement, including changes to export control restrictions, economic sanctions, and trade embargoes;

•difficulties in managing a business in new markets with diverse cultures, languages, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems, and regulatory systems;

•increased travel, real estate, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple global locations and subsidiaries;

•currency exchange rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue and expenses, and the cost and risk of hedging transactions;

•higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud, particularly the risk that excessive fraudulent activity could harm our ability to meet credit card association merchant standards and our right to accept credit cards for payment;

•restrictions on the transfer of funds, such as limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries;

•laws and business practices favoring local competitors or general market preferences for local vendors;

•reduced or uncertain intellectual property protection or difficulties obtaining, maintaining, protecting or enforcing our intellectual property rights, including foreign government interference with our intellectual property that resides outside of the U.S.;

•political instability, societal unrest, hostilities, war, or terrorist activities, including in Israel or the surrounding region where a significant portion of our Grow Solutions team is located; and subsequent retaliatory measures and sanctions;

•exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), U.S. bribery laws, the United Kingdom ("UK") Bribery Act, and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions; and 

•adverse tax burdens and foreign exchange controls that could make it difficult to repatriate earnings and cash.

We invest substantial time and resources to grow our business in markets outside the U.S. and if we are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner, our business and results of operations will suffer.

Indemnity provisions in various agreements to which we are a party potentially expose us to substantial liability for infringement, misappropriation or other violation of intellectual property rights, data protection and other losses.

Our agreements with our customers and other third parties may include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify or otherwise be liable for losses suffered or incurred as a result of 

15


Unity Software Inc.

certain claims relating to or arising from our software, services, platform, our acts or omissions under such agreements or other contractual obligations. In some cases, the liability is not limited and we may still incur substantial liability related to such agreements, and we may be required to cease providing certain functions or features on our platform as a result of any such claims. Even if we succeed in contractually limiting our liability, such limitations may not be enforceable. Any dispute with a customer or other third party with respect to such obligations could have adverse effects on our relationship with such customer or other third party and other existing or prospective customers, reduce demand for our platform and adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations. In addition, our insurance may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed on us or otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages with respect to claims, including claims on such matters as alleged compromises of customer data, which may be substantial. Any such coverage may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.

We are exposed to collection and credit risks, which could impact our operating results.

Our accounts receivable are subject to collection and credit risks, which could impact our operating results. Our Create Solutions typically include purchase commitments for a one- to three-year subscription, which may be invoiced over multiple reporting periods, increasing these risks. We rely on payments from advertisers in order to pay our Grow Solutions customers their revenue earned from our monetization solutions. We are generally obligated to pay our customers for revenue earned within a negotiated period of time, regardless of whether or not our advertisers have paid us on time, or at all. As a result, we can face a timing issue with our accounts payable on shorter cycles than our accounts receivable, requiring us to remit payments from our own funds, and accept the risk of bad debt. Businesses that are good credit risks at the time of sale may become bad credit risks over time. In times of economic recession, the number of our customers who default on payments owed to us tends to increase. Our operating results may be impacted by significant bankruptcies among customers, which could negatively impact our revenue and cash flows. We cannot assure you that our processes to monitor and mitigate these risks will be effective. If we fail to adequately assess and monitor our credit risks, we could experience longer payment cycles, increased collection costs and higher bad debt expense, and our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our operating results and financial condition.

We offer our solutions to customers globally and have operations globally. Although the majority of our cash generated from revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, revenue generated and expenses incurred by our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. are often denominated in the currencies of the local countries. As a result, our consolidated U.S. dollar financial statements have been and will continue to be subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates as the financial results of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated from local currencies into U.S. dollars. In particular, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar could continue to negatively impact our business. Our financial results are also subject to changes in exchange rates that impact the settlement of transactions in non-local currencies. Because we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, we also face remeasurement exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could hinder our ability to predict our future results and earnings and could materially impact our results of operations. We do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange fluctuations and, as a result, our financial condition and operating results have been and could continue to be adversely affected by such fluctuations.

We may require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.

We cannot be certain when or if our operations will generate sufficient cash to fully fund our ongoing operations or the growth of our business. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business and may require additional funds to do so, including the need to develop new solutions, products, services or enhance our existing solutions, products or services, enhance our operating infrastructure, expand globally and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. In addition, we may need to take other measures that would impact our liquidity. For example, under certain conditions 

16


Unity Software Inc.

we may be required to repurchase the third-party interest in our Unity China venture, which would impact our liquidity. If we incur additional debt, new debt holders would have rights senior to holders of common stock to make claims on our assets, along with our existing creditors, and the terms of any such debt could significantly restrict our operations and other activities, including our ability to make investments, and repurchase our securities. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or convertible securities, existing stockholders will experience dilution, and the new securities could have rights senior to those of holders of our common stock. Our inability to obtain adequate financing on terms satisfactory to us, or at all, when we require it, could significantly limit our ability to continue to support our business growth, respond to business challenges, expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities due to lack of sufficient capital, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Even if we are able to raise such capital, it may not enable us to achieve better operating results or grow our business.

Risks Related to Our Platform and Technology

If we do not make our platform, including new versions or technology advancements, easier to use or properly train customers on how to use our platform, our ability to broaden the appeal of our platform and solutions and to increase our revenue could suffer.

Our platform can be complex to use, and our ability to expand the appeal of our platform depends in part on ensuring that it can be used by a variety of creators. While certain features of our solutions are designed to address the needs of professional developers, we believe that our ability to expand adoption of our platform will depend in part on our ability to address the needs of creators with varied needs, preferences, and levels of expertise, as well as new categories of creators and end users in industries beyond gaming such as automotive, retail, manufacturing, healthcare, public sector, and robotics, architecture, civil and mechanical engineering, and design and construction. If we fail to effectively integrate AI and advanced technologies to simplify our user experience and broaden our appeal to creators of varying expertise—including those in non-gaming industries—users may migrate to or adopt in the first instance more accessible solutions, and our business may be harmed. Accordingly, it is important to our future success that we continue to increase the accessibility of our platform.

In order to get full use of our platform, users generally need training. We provide a variety of training resources to our customers, and we will need to continue to maintain and enhance the breadth and effectiveness of our training resources as the scope and complexity of our platform increase. Historically, most of our developers have been software engineers or have coding experience. As we expand into other industries, we must successfully make our tools and training accessible to creators and users who may not have significant software engineering or coding experience, which means that we must adapt our training accordingly, to drive adoption of our products in these industries. If we do not provide effective training resources for our customers on how to efficiently and effectively use our platform, our ability to grow our business will suffer, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. Additionally, when we announce or release new versions of our platform or advancements in our technology, we could fail to sufficiently explain or train our customers on how to use such new versions or advancements or we may announce or release such versions prematurely. These failures may lead to our customers being confused about use of our offerings or expected technology releases, and our ability to grow our business, results of operations, brand and reputation may be adversely affected. Such failures have in the past led to customers expressing frustration with our platform on social media and other internet sites.

If we or the third parties with whom we work experience a security breach or unauthorized parties otherwise obtain access to our customers' data, our data, or our platform, our platform may be perceived as not secure, our reputation may be harmed, our business operations may be disrupted, demand for our solutions may be reduced, and we may incur significant liabilities.

Operating our business and platform involves the collection, processing, storage and transmission of sensitive, proprietary and confidential information, including personal information of our personnel, 

17


Unity Software Inc.

customers and their end users, our proprietary and confidential information and the confidential information and confidential intellectual property we collect from our partners, customers and creators.

Cyber-attacks, malicious internet-based activity, online and offline fraud, and other similar activities threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our sensitive information and information technology systems, and those of the third parties with whom we work. Such threats are prevalent and continue to rise, are increasingly difficult to detect, and come from a variety of sources, including traditional computer "hackers," threat actors, "hacktivists" organized criminal threat actors, personnel (such as through theft, misuse, or accident), sophisticated nation states, and nation-state-supported actors. 

During times of war and other major conflicts, we, the third parties with whom we work, and our customers may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of these attacks, including retaliatory cyber-attacks, that could materially disrupt our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our services. For example, the increased hostilities and militarization in and around Israel, where a significant part of our Grow Solutions operations is based, may lead to an increase in politically motivated cyber-attacks which could impact our operations and harm our business.

We and the third parties with whom we work are subject to a variety of constantly evolving threats, including but not limited to, computer malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), software bugs and vulnerabilities, malicious code, viruses and worms, social engineering (including through deep fakes, which are increasingly more difficult to identify as fake, spear phishing and ransomware attacks), denial-of-service attacks, credential stuffing attacks, credential harvesting, personnel misconduct or error, supply chain attacks, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, adware, telecommunications failures, attacks enhanced or facilitated by AI and other similar threats.

Such threats have become more prevalent in our industry in recent years and the emergence of new AI technologies presents risks of further vulnerabilities. For example, attempts by malicious actors to fraudulently induce our personnel into disclosing usernames, passwords or other information that can be used to access our systems have increased and could be successful. Ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly prevalent and severe and can lead to significant interruptions, delays, or outages in our operations, loss of data, loss of income, significant extra expenses and resources to restore data or systems, reputational harm, and the diversion of funds. Extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware attack, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to, for example, applicable laws or regulations prohibiting payments. Our security measures could also be compromised by personnel, theft or errors, and have been in the past and may in the future be insufficient to prevent harm resulting from security vulnerabilities in our platform or the software or systems on which we rely. Additionally, our remote workforce poses increased risks to our IT assets and data. Future or past business transactions (such as acquisitions or integrations) could expose us to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, as our systems could be negatively affected by vulnerabilities present in acquired or integrated entities' systems and technologies. Furthermore, we may discover security issues that were not found during due diligence of such acquired or integrated entities, and it may be difficult to integrate companies into our information technology environment and security program.

We take steps designed to detect, mitigate, and remediate vulnerabilities in our information security systems, platform, and solutions. Investigations into potential incidents and insecure configurations of our services and the software we use are also an integral part of our security program. For example, we detected through our bug bounty program a vulnerability in our product that we released patched versions for in October 2025. However we have not always been, and may in the future not be, able to detect, mitigate, and remediate all such vulnerabilities. Moreover, we have experienced and may in the future experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures and patches designed to address any identified vulnerabilities. Any such remediation or patching may also be costly, difficult or impractical to implement. This is especially the case where there are multiple platforms or third-party partners involved and/or there is a lack of cooperation from other parties necessary for remediation. Security incidents could also damage our IT systems, our ability to provide our products and services, and our ability to 

18


Unity Software Inc.

make the financial reports and other public disclosures required of public companies. Additionally, vulnerabilities in our products may cause reputational harm resulting in customer loss, and it also may lead to legal liability if such vulnerabilities are exploited before we are able to release patches. Threat actors have used, and may in the future use, an initial compromise of one part of our environment to gain access to other parts of our environment, or to try to leverage a compromise of our networks or systems to gain access to the networks or systems of third parties with whom we work. They may also try to leverage potential vulnerabilities or other information in our platform or code for future attacks.

We rely on third parties to provide critical services that help us deliver our solutions and operate our business. In the course of providing their services, these third parties may support or operate critical business systems for us or store or process personal, sensitive, proprietary and/or confidential information on our behalf. Our ability to monitor these third parties' information security practices is limited and these third-party providers may not have adequate security measures, and have experienced and could experience in the future security incidents that compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the systems they operate for us or the information they process on our behalf. Supply chain attacks are increasing in frequency, and we cannot guarantee that third parties' infrastructure in our supply chain or that of the third parties with whom we work have not been compromised. Certain of our third party suppliers have experienced and may in the future experience attacks that could impact us. Such occurrences could adversely affect our business to the same degree as if we had experienced these occurrences directly and we may not have recourse to the responsible third parties for the resulting liability we incur.

We employ a shared responsibility model where our customers are responsible for using, configuring and otherwise implementing security measures related to our platform, services and products in a manner that meets applicable cybersecurity standards, complies with laws, and addresses their information security risk. As part of this shared responsibility security model, we make certain security features available to our customers that can be implemented at our customers' discretion, or identify security areas or measures for which our customers are responsible. For example, our customers are responsible for implementing multi-factor authentication to access their accounts. In certain cases where our customers choose not to implement, or incorrectly implement, those features or measures, misuse our services, or otherwise experience their own vulnerabilities, policy violations, credential exposure or security breaches, even if we are not the cause of a resulting customer security issue or incident, our customer relationships reputation, and revenue may be adversely impacted.

Because there are many different cybercrime and hacking techniques and such techniques continue to evolve, we have in the past been and may in the future be unable to anticipate attempted security breaches, react in a timely or effective manner or implement adequate preventative measures. While we have developed systems and processes designed to protect the integrity, confidentiality and security of our and our customers' confidential, proprietary, and personal information under our control or under the control of third parties with whom we work, we cannot assure you that any security measures that we or our third-party service providers have implemented has been or will in the future be effective against current or future security threats. Security breaches and other incidents have occurred in the past, and may occur in the future, resulting in unauthorized, unlawful or inappropriate access to, inability to access, disclosure of or loss of sensitive, proprietary or confidential information.

A security breach or other security incident, or the perception that one has occurred, could result in a loss of customer confidence in the security of our platform and damage to our reputation and brand, reduce demand for our solutions, disrupt normal business operations, require us to incur material costs to investigate and remedy the incident and prevent recurrence, expose us to litigation, regulatory enforcement action, fines, penalties and damages and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are likely to increase as we continue to grow and process, store and transmit an increasingly large volume of data.

We have contractual and legal obligations to notify relevant stakeholders of security breaches or to take other actions, such as providing credit monitoring and identifying theft protection services. Most jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals, regulatory authorities and others 

19


Unity Software Inc.

of security breaches involving certain types of data. In addition, our agreements with certain customers and partners may require us to notify them in the event of a security breach. Such mandatory disclosures are costly, could lead to negative publicity and may cause our customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures.

A security breach could lead to claims by our customers, their end users or other relevant parties that we have failed to comply with contractual obligations to implement specified security measures. As a result, we could be subject to legal action or our customers could end their relationships with us. We cannot assure you that the limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages. Security breaches could similarly result in enforcement actions by government authorities alleging that we have violated laws requiring us to maintain reasonable security measures.

Additionally, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data security liabilities actually incurred, will cover any indemnification claims against us relating to any incident, will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, we continue to expend significant costs to seek to protect our platform and solutions and to introduce additional security features for our customers, and we expect to continue to have to expend significant costs in the future. Any increase in these costs will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Interruptions, performance problems, or defects associated with our platform may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our reputation and ability to attract and retain customers and grow our business depend in part on our ability to operate our platform at high levels of reliability, scalability and performance, including the ability of our existing and potential customers to access our platform at any time and within an acceptable amount of time. Interruptions in the performance of our platform and solutions, whether due to system failures, computer viruses or physical or electronic break-ins, could affect the availability of our platform. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, introductions of new functionality, human or software errors, capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of customers accessing our platform simultaneously, denial-of-service attacks or other security-related incidents.

It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times and as our customer base grows and our platform becomes more complex. If our platform is unavailable or difficult to update, or our solutions are difficult or time-consuming to update or if our customers are unable to access our platform within a reasonable amount of time or at all, we may experience a loss of customers, lost or delayed market acceptance of our platform, delays in payment to us by customers, injury to our reputation and brand, legal claims against us, significant costs of remedying these problems and the diversion of our resources. In addition, to the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our reputation, may be adversely affected. For example, due to heightened concerns about the regulatory environment with respect to privacy and security matters, our customers are increasingly requesting audit certifications, such as SOC 2, Type II, that we have not yet achieved with respect to some of our offerings. Failure to achieve these certifications may adversely impact our ability to grow our business at the pace that may be expected by our investors. Additionally, material interruptions to our service due to security-related incidents may expose us to regulatory fines in certain jurisdictions where we operate even in the absence of data loss.

20


Unity Software Inc.

Further, the software technology underlying our platform is inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors, particularly when new solutions are first introduced or when new features or capabilities are released. We have from time to time found defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our platform and solutions, and new ones may be detected in the future by us or our users. For example, we announced and remediated a vulnerability in our platform in October 2025. 

We cannot assure you that our existing platform and new offerings will not contain defects or vulnerabilities or that they will not be exploited. Any real or perceived errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs in our platform could result in negative publicity or lead to data security, access, retention or other performance issues, all of which could harm our business. The costs incurred in correcting such defects. errors or vulnerabilities may be substantial and could harm our business. Such errors, defects and vulnerabilities often also require remediation efforts by our customers and other partners. Moreover, the harm to our reputation and legal liability we may incur related to such occurrences may be substantial and could similarly harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Any failure to obtain, maintain, protect or enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand.

Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, including our proprietary technology, know-how and our brand, and we may not be able to adequately do so. We will not be able to protect our intellectual property rights if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, or fail to continuously innovate and advance our technology, our competitors could gain access to our proprietary technology and develop and commercialize substantially identical products, services or technologies. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense. Any patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights that we have or may obtain may be challenged or circumvented by others or invalidated or held unenforceable through administrative processes. In addition, we cannot assure you that our patent applications will result in issued patents, and we may be unable to obtain or maintain patent protection for our technology. In addition, any patents issued from pending or future patent applications or licensed to us in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our solutions and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products that compete with ours. Patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our solutions are available. The value of our intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of our trademarks and other intellectual property rights, or trademarks that are similar to our trademarks. We may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In some cases, litigation or other actions may be necessary to protect or enforce our trademarks and other intellectual property rights. Furthermore, third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us, and we may be subject to liability, required to enter into costly license agreements, required to rebrand our solutions or prevented from selling some of our solutions if third parties successfully oppose or challenge our trademarks or successfully claim that we infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate their trademarks or other intellectual property rights. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the U.S., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. As we expand our global activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our platform and proprietary information will likely increase. Moreover, policing unauthorized use of our technologies, trade secrets and intellectual property may be difficult, expensive and time-consuming, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the U.S. and where mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be weak. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights.

We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with other third parties, including suppliers and other 

21


Unity Software Inc.

partners. However, we cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that has or may have had access to our proprietary information, know-how and trade secrets or that has or may have developed intellectual property in connection with their engagement with us. Moreover, we cannot assure you that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to, distribution, use, misuse, misappropriation, reverse engineering or disclosure of our proprietary information, know-how and trade secrets. Further, these agreements may not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our platform. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach.

In order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. For example, we have commenced in the past and may in the future commence litigation proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights, such as rights under our software licenses, and to protect our trade secrets. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management, and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Further, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights, and if such defenses, counterclaims or countersuits are successful, we could lose valuable intellectual property rights. Our inability to enforce our unique licensing structure, including financial eligibility tiers, and our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, including circumvention of licensing or usage restrictions as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management's attention and resources, could delay further sales or the implementation of our solutions, impair the functionality of our platform, delay introductions of new solutions, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our offerings, or injure our reputation.

We license and make available software and source code to customers. Although those customers are restricted in the manner in which they can use and share our software, we cannot assure you that unauthorized use or copying of our software or source code will not occur. Such copying and use has occurred in the past, and while we actively take steps to stop this activity, we may not always be successful. We also rely on periodic significant updates to our software to encourage our customers to access our software through us on a paying or, for qualified users, non-paying, basis. However, we cannot assure you that this strategy will be effective in ensuring that users are not circumventing licensing or usage restrictions or otherwise misusing or accessing our software on an unauthorized basis.

Our ability to acquire and maintain licenses to intellectual property may affect our revenue and profitability. These licenses may become more expensive and increase our costs.

While most of the intellectual property we use is created by us, we have also acquired rights to proprietary intellectual property that provide key features and functionality in our solutions. We have also obtained rights to use intellectual property through licenses and service agreements with third parties.

Proprietary licenses typically limit our use of intellectual property to specific uses and for specific time periods. If we are unable to maintain these licenses or obtain additional licenses on reasonable economic terms or with significant commercial value, our revenue and profitability may be adversely impacted. These licenses may become more expensive and increase the advances, guarantees and royalties that we may pay to the licensor, which could significantly increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability.

We have been and may in the future become subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly and may subject us to significant liability and increased costs of doing business.

We have faced and may in the future, face intellectual property disputes. Such disputes and intellectual property litigation can be time-consuming and expensive to resolve and they divert management's time and attention. Companies in the internet, technology and gaming industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and trade secrets and frequently litigate allegations of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims against their use. In addition, many 

22


Unity Software Inc.

companies have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend against claims that may be brought against them. Any litigation may also involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners that have no relevant product revenue, and therefore, our patents and patent applications may provide little or no deterrence as we would not be able to assert them against such entities or individuals. If a third party is able to obtain an injunction as a remedy for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights and if we cannot license or develop alternative technology, we may be forced to limit or stop sales of our solutions or cease business activities related to such intellectual property. In addition, we may need to settle litigation and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us. Although we carry general liability insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. We cannot predict the outcome of lawsuits and cannot ensure that the results of any such actions will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any intellectual property claim asserted against us, or for which we are required to provide indemnification, may require us to do one or more of the following:

•cease selling or using solutions that incorporate the intellectual property rights that we allegedly infringe, misappropriate or violate;

•make substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments or other costs or damages;

•obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, to sell or use the relevant technology; or

•redesign or rebrand the allegedly infringing solutions to avoid infringement, misappropriation or violation, which could be costly, time-consuming or impossible.

Even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. We expect that the occurrence of infringement claims is likely to grow as the market for our solutions grows. Accordingly, our exposure to damages resulting from infringement claims could increase, and this could further exhaust our financial and management resources.

We use open source software in our solutions, which could negatively affect our ability to sell our services or subject us to litigation or other actions.

We use open source software in our solutions, and we expect to continue to incorporate open source software in our solutions in the future. Few of the licenses applicable to open source software have been interpreted by courts, and these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. Moreover, we cannot ensure that we have not incorporated open source software in our software in a manner that is inconsistent with the terms of the applicable license. Depending on the terms of certain of these licenses, we may be subject to certain requirements, including that we make source code available for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of applicable open source licenses. If an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the sale of our solutions that contained the open source software and required to comply with onerous conditions or restrictions on these solutions, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of these solutions. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership rights in open source software against companies that incorporate it into their products, and the licensors of such open source software provide no warranties or indemnities with respect to such claims. As a result, we and our customers could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our solutions, either of which could harm our business. In 

23


Unity Software Inc.

addition, although we employ open source software license screening measures, if we were to combine our proprietary software solutions with certain open source software in a particular manner we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software solutions. Some open source projects have known vulnerabilities and architectural instabilities and are provided on an "as-is" basis which, if not properly addressed, could negatively affect the performance of our solution or lead to security incidents. If we inappropriately use or incorporate open source software subject to certain types of open source licenses that challenge the proprietary nature of our solutions, we may be required to re-engineer such solutions, discontinue the sale of such solutions or take other remedial actions.

Our business depends on the interoperability of our solutions across third-party platforms, operating systems, and applications, and on our ability to ensure our platform and solutions operate effectively on those platforms. If we are not able to integrate our solutions with third-party platforms in a timely manner, our business may be harmed.

One of the most important features of our platform and solutions is broad interoperability with a range of diverse devices, operating systems and third-party applications. Our customers rely on our solutions to create and simultaneously deploy content to a variety of third-party platforms. Similarly, we and our customers also rely on our solutions' interoperability with third-party platforms in order to deliver services. Currently, we support over 25 such platforms. Third-party platforms are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to modify our solutions to assure compatibility with that of other third parties following development changes within a timely manner. For example, third-party platforms frequently deploy updates to their hardware or software and modify their system requirements. The success of our business depends on our ability to incorporate these updates to third-party licensed software into our technology, effectively respond to changes to device and operating system platform requirements, and maintain our relationships with third-party platform owners. Our success also depends on our ability to simultaneously manage solutions on multiple platforms and our ability to effectively deploy our solutions to an increasing number of new platforms. Given the number of platforms we support, it can be difficult to keep pace with the number of third-party updates that are required in order to provide the interoperability our customers demand. If we fail to effectively respond to changes or updates to third-party platforms that we support, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.

We rely upon third-party data centers and providers of cloud-based infrastructure to host our platform. Any disruption in the operations of these third-party providers, limitations on capacity or interference with our use could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We currently serve our users from co-located data centers in the U.S. We also use various third-party cloud hosting providers such as Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, and Tencent to provide cloud infrastructure for our platform. Our Create Solutions and Grow Solutions rely on the operations of this infrastructure. Customers need to be able to access our platform at any time, without interruption or degradation of performance, and we provide some customers with service-level commitments with respect to uptime. In addition, our Grow Solutions and enterprise game server hosting depend on the ability of these data centers and cloud infrastructure to allow for our customers' configuration, architecture, features and interconnection specifications and to secure the information stored in these data centers. Any limitation on the capacity of our data centers or cloud infrastructure could impede our ability to onboard new customers or expand the usage of our existing customers, host our solutions or serve our customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any incident affecting our data centers or cloud infrastructure that may be caused by cyber-attacks, natural disasters, fire, flood, severe storm, earthquake, power loss, outbreaks of contagious diseases, telecommunications failures, terrorist or other attacks and other similar events beyond our control could negatively affect the cloud-based portion of our platform. A prolonged service disruption affecting our data centers or cloud-based services for any of the foregoing reasons would negatively impact our ability to serve our customers and could damage our reputation with current and potential customers, expose us to liability, cause us to lose customers or otherwise harm our business. 

24


Unity Software Inc.

We may also incur significant costs for using alternative providers or taking other actions in preparation for, or in response to, events that damage the third-party hosting services we use.

In the event that our service agreements relating to our data centers or cloud infrastructure are terminated, or there is a lapse of service, elimination of services or features that we utilize, interruption of internet service provider connectivity or damage to such facilities, we could experience interruptions in access to our platform, loss of revenue from revenue-share and consumption-based solutions, as well as significant delays and additional expense in arranging or creating new facilities and services or re-architecting our platform for deployment on a different data center provider or cloud infrastructure service provider, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Related to Our Management, Talent, and Brand

Attracting, managing, and retaining our talent is critical to our success.

Our success and future growth depend upon the continued services of our management team and other key employees. Changes in our management team could disrupt our business. We have experienced significant management turnover in the last two years and any inability to successfully manage executive transitions, or to retain senior executives or key employees, or find adequate replacements, could disrupt our operations and harm our business.

In addition, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel, such as software engineers because of the complexity of our solutions. We have had difficulty quickly filling certain open positions in the past, and we expect to have future hiring needs. Competition is intense, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area and other areas in which we have offices, for engineers experienced in designing and developing cloud-based platform solutions, data scientists and engineers with experience in AI and ML, as well as experienced sales professionals. The market for AI and ML engineers and data scientists is extremely competitive and expensive and we have in the past faced, and continue to face, challenges in hiring and subsequently retaining such personnel. Failure to secure or retain adequate AI/ML talent could put us at a competitive disadvantage and result in slower product development. Failure to retain such talent could also result in the potential loss of valuable skills, know-how and intellectual property to competitors. New employees may not become as productive as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals. As a global workforce, we must align our company values across employees from different cultures and value systems, and often with employees who are geographically remote from one another. Failure to successfully create a cohesive company culture could harm our ability to attract and retain talent.

In addition, prospective and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived or actual value of our equity awards declines, it may not be as effective an incentive for attracting, retaining, and motivating employees. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects would be harmed.

If we fail to maintain and enhance our brand, our ability to expand our customer base will be impaired and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may suffer.

We believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand reputation is important to our ability to compete and to support the marketing and sale of our platforms and products to new and existing customers and grow our strategic partnerships. Successfully maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, our ability to offer a reliable platform that continues to meet the needs and preferences of our customers at competitive prices, our ability to maintain our customers' trust, our ability to continue to develop new functionality to address a wide variety of use cases and our ability to successfully differentiate our platform from competitors. We have in the past and may in the future experience public scrutiny of our business decisions and announcements.

Our ability to manage potential social and ethical issues arising out of emerging technologies, including AI, could impact our brand and customer adoption of our solutions. Our brand promotion activities may not generate customer awareness or yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any 

25


Unity Software Inc.

increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.

Risks Related to Laws, Regulations, and the Global Economy

We and the third parties with whom we work are subject to rapidly changing and increasingly stringent laws, regulations, contractual obligations, industry standards and other obligations relating to privacy, data security, and the protection of children. The restrictions and costs imposed by these requirements, or our actual or perceived failure to comply with them, could harm our business.

Our offerings, and particularly our Grow Solutions and their access to unique runtime data through our Developer Data Framework, rely on our ability to process sensitive, proprietary, confidential, and regulated information, including personal information, that belongs to us or that we, or the third parties with whom we work, handle on behalf of others such as our customers. These activities are regulated by an increasing number of federal, state, local, and foreign privacy and data security laws and regulations. These laws have become increasingly stringent and continue to evolve, requiring significant resources for compliance. Any actual or perceived noncompliance could result in litigation, regulatory proceedings, fines and civil or criminal penalties, obligations to cease offerings or to substantially modify our Grow Solutions in ways that make them less effective in certain jurisdictions, negative publicity, reduced overall demand for our platform and reduced returns on our Grow Solutions. As we continue to rebuild and enhance our ML stack and data infrastructure, we may encounter challenges in complying with data privacy and similar laws aimed at regulating technology.

Most jurisdictions in which we or our customers operate have adopted privacy and data security laws. For example, European privacy and data security laws, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ("EU GDPR"), the European Union's Digital Services Act, the United Kingdom's GDPR ("U.K. GDPR") and others, impose significant and complex burdens on the processing of personal information and provide for robust regulatory enforcement and significant penalties for noncompliance. Regulators, courts, and platforms have increasingly interpreted privacy and data security laws to require opt-in consent to use cookies and similar technologies for personalization, advertising, and analytics. Any of these could increase our exposure to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions, increase our compliance costs, and adversely affect our business.

In addition, jurisdictions may enact or have already enacted data localization and cross-border data transfer laws. Certain countries have enacted or are considering enacting cross-border data transfer restrictions and laws requiring data residency. The EU GDPR, U.K. GDPR, and other European privacy and data security laws generally prohibit the transfer of personal information to countries outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"), such as the U.S., that are not considered by some authorities as generally providing an adequate level of data protection.

The various mechanisms that may be used to comply with these data localization and other requirements are subject to legal challenges, and the future of cross-border data transfers remains uncertain,which could increase the cost and complexity of doing business. If we cannot maintain a valid mechanism for cross-border personal information transfers, we may face increased exposure to regulatory actions, litigation, penalties, data processing restrictions or bans, and reduced demand for our services. Loss of our ability to import personal information from Europe and elsewhere may also require us to increase our data processing capabilities outside the U.S. at significant expense.

Similarly, China's Personal Information Protection Law and Data Security Law, Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, related provincial laws, and Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation, Israel's Privacy Protection Law 5741-1981, and new and emerging privacy and data security regimes in other jurisdictions in which we operate, broadly regulate the processing of personal information and impose comprehensive compliance obligations and penalties.

In the U.S., federal, state, and local governments have enacted numerous privacy and data security laws, such as, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act ("TCPA"), which imposes various consumer 

26


Unity Software Inc.

consent requirements and other restrictions on telemarketing activity and violations of which, or similar laws enacted by states, can result in significant financial penalties. In addition, the CCPA, which applies to personal information of consumers, business representatives, employees, and other individuals with whom we interact, imposes a number of obligations on covered businesses, including requirements to respond to requests from California residents related to their personal information and contains significant potential penalties for noncompliance.

Other states have enacted or are considering enacting privacy and data security laws, and our actual or perceived noncompliance with these and other emerging state laws could harm our business. The U.S. Department of Justice has also adopted a new rule entitled Preventing Access to U.S. Sensitive Personal Data and Government-Related Data by Countries of Concern or Covered Persons, which limits our ability to provide access to certain US personal information to entities or employees located in certain countries of concern, thereby impacting usage of data by us and certain partners, impacting our ability to enter into certain investment agreements, and potentially limiting our ability to utilize employees in certain locations. Violations of the rule could lead to significant civil and criminal fines and penalties.

In addition, some of our solutions employ technology to help creators build augmented and virtual reality applications, and their use to recognize and collect information about individuals could be perceived as subject to emerging regulations relating to biometric privacy laws. Actual or perceived violations of the foregoing laws and regulations can lead to significant civil and/or criminal fines and penalties, and expose us to litigation and regulatory risks.

Another area of increasing focus by regulators is children's privacy. Enforcement of longstanding privacy laws, such as the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), has increased and may continue under the new generation of privacy and data security laws and regulations, such as the GDPR, CCPA, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office Age-Appropriate Design Code ("Children's Code"), and the California Age-Appropriate Design Code Act ("Design Code"), and similar laws enacted by other U.S. states. European regulators are expected to introduce guidance for age-appropriate design across all countries implementing the GDPR as well. We have previously been subject to claims related to the privacy of minors predicated on COPPA and other privacy and data security laws, and we may in the future face claims.

In addition to increasing government regulation, we have obligations relating to privacy and data security under our published policies and documentation, contracts and applicable industry standards. For example, we are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ("PCI DSS"), which requires companies to adopt certain measures to ensure the security of cardholder information, including using and maintaining firewalls, adopting proper password protections for certain devices and software, and restricting data access, and noncompliance which can result in significant penalties (up to $100,000 per month imposed by credit card companies), litigation, damage to our reputation, and revenue losses.

We and our customers are increasingly subject to specialized regulations governing digital storefronts and in-app purchasing, particularly those focused on the protection of minors. For example, the Texas App Store Accountability Act and similar statutes enacted or proposed in other states and territories impose new obligations on both application store operators and developers. These laws may require us to implement age-verification and parental consent workflows, including the ability to act upon age-category signals from third-party platforms, for ourselves or on behalf of our developers. Complying with these evolving and fragmented requirements could result in significant operational costs, necessitate substantial changes to our user interfaces and flows, and increase our exposure to enforcement actions. Any failure, or perceived failure, to satisfy these shifting in-app purchasing and age-assurance standards could lead to platform-wide penalties and other enforcement actions against Unity and the developers or third parties who may rely on our compliance mechanisms, reduce scale and usage of our monetization solutions, and materially harm our business.

Our business is materially reliant on revenue from behavioral, interest-based, or tailored advertising (collectively, "targeted advertising"), but delivering targeted advertisements is becoming increasingly difficult due to changes to our ability to gather information about user behavior through third-party platforms, new laws and regulations, and consumer resistance. Major technology platforms on which we 

27


Unity Software Inc.

rely to gather information about consumers have adopted or proposed measures to provide consumers with additional control over the collection, use, and sharing of their personal data for targeted advertising purposes. For example, Apple allows users to easily opt-out of activity tracking across devices, which has impacted and may continue to impact our business. Similarly, Google has plans to adopt additional privacy controls on its Android devices to allow users to limit sharing of their data with third parties and reduce cross-device tracking for advertising purposes.

In addition, legislative proposals and existing laws and regulations regulate the use of cookies and other tracking technologies, electronic communications, and marketing. European regulators have issued significant fines in certain circumstances where they alleged that appropriate consent was not obtained. In the EU, there are additional laws under consideration that may impact the gaming ecosystem, including demand for our products and services. For example, the Digital Omnibus Act, if adopted, may introduce uncertainty as to whether current interpretations of the e-Privacy Directive and GDPR, against which our products are designed, will remain viable. and may negatively impact our operations. Additionally, the Digital Fairness Act, if adopted, may place limits on way game developers can design and monetize their games through our platform. In addition, individuals are becoming increasingly resistant to the collection, use, and sharing of personal data to deliver targeted advertising. As a result, we have been and may be required to change the way we market our offerings, and any of these developments or changes could materially impair our ability to reach new or existing customers or otherwise negatively affect our operations. An additional concern is increasing litigation under novel interpretations of state and federal wiretapping laws. Such claims and demands are regularly received by businesses throughout the United States, including by Unity.

Regulation of data security programs is creating new and additional audit and operational burdens. Laws such as the Cyber Resilience Act in the EU and audit requirements found in California’s CCPA regulations may increase our costs of compliance.

Although we endeavor to comply with these obligations, we may have actually or allegedly failed to do so or have otherwise processed data improperly. The requirements imposed by rapidly changing privacy and data security laws, platform providers, and application stores require us to dedicate significant resources to compliance, and could also limit our ability to operate, harm our reputation, reduce demand for our solutions, and subject us to regulatory enforcement action, private litigation, and other liability. Such occurrences could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our customers have sought increasingly stringent contractual obligations regarding privacy and data security. These contractual obligations, and our efforts to comply with them, could be costly and harm our business.

In response to the increasing restrictions of global privacy and data security laws, our customers have sought and may continue to seek increasingly stringent contractual assurances regarding our handling of personal information and may adopt internal policies that limit their use of our Grow Solutions. In addition, privacy advocates and industry groups have regularly proposed, and may propose in the future, self-regulatory standards by which we are legally or contractually bound. If we fail to comply with these contractual obligations or standards, we may face substantial contractual liability or fines.

Adverse changes in the geopolitical relationship between the U.S. and China or changes in China's economic and regulatory landscape could have an adverse effect on business conditions.

Because our continued business operations in China, including our joint venture in China, constitute a significant part of our current and future revenue growth plans, adverse changes in economic and political policies relating to China could have an adverse effect on our business. An escalation of trade tensions in recent years between the U.S. and China has resulted in trade restrictions that harm our ability to participate in Chinese markets. For example, U.S. export control regulations relating to China have created restrictions with respect to the sale of our solutions to various Chinese customers and further changes to regulations have occurred in 2025 that could result in additional restrictions on our sales when effective in October 2026. China also regulates the gaming industry, including content distribution restrictions and other regulations which has impacted our growth rates in the past and any 

28


Unity Software Inc.

changes by the Chinese government with respect to the gaming industry could have a negative impact on our business. Sustained uncertainty about, or worsening of, current global economic conditions and further escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners, especially China, could result in a global economic slowdown and long-term changes to global trade, including retaliatory trade restrictions that further restrict our ability to operate in China.

Any actions and policies adopted by the government of the People's Republic of China ("PRC"), particularly with regard to intellectual property rights and existing cloud-based and Internet restrictions for non-Chinese businesses, or any prolonged slowdown in China's economy, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

In particular, PRC laws and regulations impose restrictions on foreign ownership of companies that engage in internet, market survey, game publishing, cloud-based services and other related businesses from time to time. Accordingly, our ability to offer game publishing and cloud-based services in China depends on our ability to implement and maintain structures that are acceptable under PRC laws. Our failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.

International trade policies, including tariffs, sanctions and trade barriers may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Volatile international trade policies have created a dynamic and unpredictable trade landscape, which may adversely impact our business. Although our current business model is not directly reliant on the import or export of physical goods, trade policies may indirectly adversely impact our business and operations. For example, current and future tariffs on hardware, networking infrastructure or other technology infrastructure used by us or our third-party vendors could raise costs, constrain supply or affect service reliability, which could harm our competitive position, reduce customer demand and damage customer relationships. In addition, many of our customers operate businesses that may be impacted by trade policies, which may result in decreased demand for our services or extended sales cycles as customers assess the impact of evolving trade policies on their operations and face increased costs or decreased revenue due to tariffs and trade restrictions. Trade disputes, trade restrictions, tariffs, and other political tensions between the U.S. and other countries may also exacerbate unfavorable macroeconomic conditions including inflationary pressures, foreign exchange volatility, financial market instability, and economic recessions or downturns, which may also negatively impact customer demand for our services, delay renewals or limit expansion opportunities with existing customers, limit our access to capital, or otherwise negatively impact our business and operations. Ongoing tariff and macroeconomic uncertainty has and may continue to contribute to volatility in the price of our common stock. In addition, retaliatory trade policies or anti-U.S. sentiment in certain regions, whether driven by trade tensions, political disagreements, or regulatory concerns, may make customers and governments more hesitant to adopt solutions offered by U.S.-based providers. This may lead to increased preference for local competitors, changes to government procurement policies, heightened regulatory scrutiny, decreased intellectual property protections, delays in regulatory approvals or other retaliatory regulatory non-tariff policies, the introduction of trade barriers applicable to digital services, which may result in heightened international legal and operational risks and difficulties in attracting and retaining non-U.S. customers, suppliers, employees, partners and investors. While we continue to monitor trade developments, the ultimate impact of these risks remains uncertain and any prolonged economic downturn, escalation in trade tensions, or deterioration in international perception of U.S.-based companies could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, tariffs and other trade developments have and may continue to heighten the risks related to the other risk factors described elsewhere in this report.

We are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, and similar laws, and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal or civil liability and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to the FCPA, U.S. domestic bribery laws, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which we conduct activities. As we increase our global sales and business to the public sector and further develop our reseller channel, we may 

29


Unity Software Inc.

engage with business partners and third-party intermediaries to market our solutions and obtain necessary permits, licenses and other regulatory approvals. In addition, we or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners and agents, even if we do not authorize such activities.

Compliance with such laws is costly, we cannot assure you that none of our employees and agents will take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible.

In addition, noncompliance with these laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, civil or criminal penalties, reputational harm, and adverse media coverage any of which could harm our business.

We are subject to governmental export and import controls and economic sanctions laws that could impair our ability to compete in global markets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls.

Various countries in which we operate regulate the import and export of certain encryption and other technology, including import and export licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our solutions or could limit our customers' ability to implement our solutions in those countries. Our products and services are subject to export controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations of the United States and potentially other jurisdictions in which we have operations. Compliance with such laws and regulations can be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.

If we, or our resellers, are found to be in violation of U.S. sanctions or export control regulations, significant fines or penalties and possible incarceration for responsible employees and managers, as well as reputational harm and loss of business, could result.

Any change in export or import regulations--including proposed additional regulation of encryption technology--economic sanctions or related legislation, increased export and import controls, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our platform by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our solutions to, existing or potential customers with global operations which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and growth prospects.

Companies and governmental agencies may restrict access to our platforms, website, mobile applications, application stores or the Internet generally, which could lead to the loss or slower growth of our customers' end users and negatively impact our operations.

Governmental agencies in any of the countries in which we, our customers or end users are located, such as China, could block access to or require a license for our platform, our website, mobile applications, operating system platforms, application stores or the Internet generally for a number of reasons, including security, confidentiality or regulatory concerns. If companies or governmental entities block, limit or otherwise restrict customers from accessing our platform, or end users from playing games developed or operated on our platform, our business could be harmed.

Further, some countries may block data transfers as a result of businesses collecting data within a country's borders as part of broader privacy-related concerns, which could affect our business. For example, the Indian government blocked the distribution of several applications of Chinese origin in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, defense of India, and security of the Indian state. In undertaking this action, the Indian government temporarily and partially blocked some of Unity's services. More recently, the U.S. Department of Justice’s implementation of bulk transfer restrictions to certain countries of concern has necessitated product and operational changes in order to maintain compliance. If additional or more severe data transfer restrictions are implemented, or if other countries block our data 

30


Unity Software Inc.

transfers or services or take similar action against us, our customers, our services, and our business could be harmed.

Sales to government entities and highly regulated organizations are subject to a number of challenges and risks.

We sell our offerings, particularly within our Create Solutions, to a variety of domestic and foreign governmental agency customers, as well as to customers in highly regulated industries. Selling to such entities can be highly competitive, expensive and time-consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale. Government demand and payment for solutions are affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, funding reductions, shutdowns by the federal government or other delays that have affected and may affect public sector demand that could develop for our solutions.

Further, these entities may demand or require contract terms and product features or certifications that differ from our standard arrangements and are less favorable or more difficult to maintain than our standard terms or product features. If we are unable to agree to contracting requirements of governmental or regulated entities, we may be limited in our ability to sell our solutions to these customers. Such entities may have statutory, contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with us or our partners for convenience or for other reasons. Any such termination may adversely affect our ability to provide our platform to other government customers and could adversely impact our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.

We could be required to collect additional sales, value added or similar taxes or be subject to other tax liabilities that may increase the costs our clients would have to pay for our solutions and adversely affect our results of operations.

We collect sales, value added or similar indirect taxes in a number of jurisdictions. An increasing number of states have considered or adopted laws that attempt to impose sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state companies. Similarly, many foreign jurisdictions have considered or adopted laws that impose taxes on companies despite not having a physical presence in the foreign jurisdiction, including digital service taxes. A successful assertion by one or more states, or foreign jurisdictions, requiring us to collect taxes where we presently do not do so, or to collect more taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently do collect some taxes, could result in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and interest. This could also create additional administrative burdens for us, put us at a competitive disadvantage if they do not impose similar obligations on our competitors, and decrease our future sales, which could harm our business and results of operations.

Changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our effective tax rate could increase due to several factors, including:

•changes in the relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;

•changes in tax laws, tax treaties, and regulations or the interpretation of them, including Pillar One and Pillar Two related taxes as proposed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (the "OECD") and which began to be implemented by many jurisdictions in which we operate in 2024. At this time, we do not expect Pillar Two legislation to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements;

•changes to our assessment of our ability to realize our deferred tax assets that are based on estimates of our future results, the feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic and political environments in which we do business;

•the outcome of current and future tax audits, examinations or administrative appeals; and

•limitations or adverse findings regarding our ability to do business in some jurisdictions.

31


Unity Software Inc.

Any of these developments could adversely affect our results of operations.

Uncertainties in the interpretation and application of existing, new and proposed tax laws and regulations could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate.

The tax regimes to which we are subject or under which we operate are unsettled and may be subject to significant change. The issuance of additional guidance related to existing or future tax laws, or changes to tax laws, tax treaties or regulations proposed or implemented by the current or a future U.S. presidential administration, Congress, or taxing authorities in other jurisdictions, including jurisdictions outside of the United States, could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. To the extent that such changes have a negative impact on us, including as a result of related uncertainty, these changes may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

The amount of taxes we pay in different jurisdictions depends on the application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions, including the United States, to our international business activities, the relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, new or revised tax laws, or interpretations of tax laws and policies, the outcome of current and future tax audits, examinations or administrative appeals, our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, and our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements.

Our ability to use our net operating losses, credits, and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income or taxes may be subject to certain limitations.

As of December 31, 2025, we had net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards for U.S. federal, state, and foreign purposes of $685 million, $477 million, and $1.1 billion, respectively, which may be available to offset taxable income in the future, and portions of which expire in various years beginning in 2026. A lack of future taxable income would adversely affect our ability to utilize a portion of these NOL carryforwards before they expire. U.S. federal NOLs incurred in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, may be carried forward indefinitely, but such federal NOL carryforwards are permitted to be used in any taxable year to offset only up to 80% of taxable income in such year. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), a corporation that undergoes an "ownership change" (as defined under Section 382 of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations) is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOL carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to offset post-change taxable income or taxes. We may experience future ownership changes that could affect our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards to offset our income. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOL carryforwards of companies that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOL carryforwards is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize all of our NOL carryforwards, even if we attain profitability, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 

The tax benefits that are available to us require us to continue to meet various conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future, which could increase our costs and taxes.

We believe that our main Israeli subsidiaries acquired as part of the ironSource Merger are eligible for certain tax benefits provided to a "Preferred Technological Enterprise" under the Israeli Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 5719-1959 (the "Investment Law"). In order to remain eligible for the tax benefits provided to a "Preferred Technological Enterprise" we must continue to meet certain conditions stipulated in the Investment Law and its regulations, as amended. If these tax benefits are reduced, canceled or discontinued, our Israeli taxable income from the Preferred Technological Enterprise would be subject to a higher corporate tax rate in Israel. The standard corporate tax rate for Israeli companies has been 23% since 2018.

Any legal proceedings, claims against us, or other disputes could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could harm our reputation regardless of the outcome.

We have been and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time, such as claims brought by our customers in connection with commercial disputes, employment claims made by our current or former employees, or securities class action litigation suits. Any litigation or dispute, whether meritorious or not, and whether or not covered by insurance, could harm our reputation, will increase our costs and may divert management's attention, time and resources, which may in turn harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, many of which are unsettled and still developing and which could increase our costs or adversely affect our business.

We are subject to a variety of laws in the U.S. and abroad that affect our business, including state and federal laws regarding consumer protection, advertising, electronic marketing, protection of minors, AI, privacy and data security, data localization requirements, online services, anti-competition, labor, real estate, taxation, intellectual property ownership and infringement, export and national security, tariffs, anti-corruption and telecommunications, all of which are continuously evolving and developing, many of which are discussed in greater detail above. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly laws outside the U.S., and compliance with laws, regulations and similar requirements may be burdensome and expensive. Laws and regulations may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, which may increase the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could make our platform less attractive to our customers or cause us to change or limit our ability to sell our platform. Our employees, contractors, or agents may violate such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures, which could harm our business.

For example, as a result of our Grow Solutions, we are potentially subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect the offering of certain types of content, such as that which depicts violence, many of which are ambiguous, still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business or expose us to liability. In addition, there are ongoing academic, political and regulatory discussions in various jurisdictions regarding whether certain game mechanisms, such as loot boxes, and game genres, such as social casino, rewarded gaming and gambling, should be subject to a higher level or different type of regulation than other game genres or mechanics to protect consumers, in particular minors and persons susceptible to addiction, and, if so, what such regulation should include. New regulation by the U.S. federal government and its agencies, such as the FTC, U.S. states and state agencies or foreign jurisdictions, which may vary significantly across jurisdictions, could require that certain game content be modified or removed from games, increase the costs of operating our customer's games, impact player engagement and thus the functionality and effectiveness of our Grow Solutions or otherwise harm our business performance. For example, one of our acquired products within our Grow Solutions, Tapjoy's Offerwall, is subject to certain obligations under a consent order which resulted from an FTC investigation. Noncompliance with this consent order, or other future orders, may result in the imposition of substantial fines, penalties and costs that would adversely impact our financial condition and operating results. It is difficult to predict how existing or new laws may be applied. If we become liable, directly or indirectly, under these laws or regulations, we could be harmed, and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to modify our Grow Solutions, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

It is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted or construed to apply to us or our customers in the U.S. and elsewhere that could restrict the online and mobile industries, including player privacy, advertising, taxation, content suitability, copyright, distribution, antitrust, and the use of 

33


Unity Software Inc.

artificial intelligence, and therefore our solutions or components may be deemed or perceived illegal or unfair practices. Furthermore, the growth and development of electronic commerce and virtual items may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as us and our customers conducting business through the Internet and mobile devices. We anticipate that scrutiny and regulation of our industry will increase, and we will be required to devote legal and other resources to addressing such regulation. For example, existing laws or new laws regarding the marketing or the use of in-app purchasing or such enabling technology, labeling of free-to-play games or regulation of currency, banking institutions, unclaimed property or money transmission may be interpreted to cover games made with our solutions and the revenue that we receive from our Grow Solutions. If that were to occur, we may be required to seek licenses, authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators, the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight, all of which could significantly increase our operating costs. Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the U.S. or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of mobile gaming and impair our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Risks Related to Our Convertible Notes

Our Notes and the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of the Notes, if any, may impact our financial results, result in dilution to our stockholders, create downward pressure on the price of our common stock, and restrict our ability to raise additional capital or to engage in a beneficial takeover.

In February 2025, we issued approximately $690 million in aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due 2030 (the "2030 Notes"), in November 2022, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2.0% convertible senior notes due 2027 (the "2027 Notes"), and in November 2021, we issued approximately $1.7 billion in aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due 2026 (the "2026 Notes," together with the 2030 Notes and 2027 Notes, the "Notes"). In the first quarter of 2025 and first quarter of 2024, we repurchased approximately $688 million and $480 million, respectively, aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes in privately negotiated transactions with holders of the 2026 Notes and as of December 31, 2025, we had approximately $558 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 Notes outstanding. We are subject to a variety of risks related to the Notes, such as:

•servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt, and our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest, or to refinance or repurchase our Notes depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control;

•our ability to refinance or repurchase our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time, and if we are unable to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, we may be unable to meet the obligations of our Notes;

•if shares of our common stock are issued to the holders of the Notes upon conversion, there will be dilution to our stockholders' equity and the market price of our common stock may decrease due to the additional selling pressure in the market. Any such downward pressure on the price of our common stock could also encourage short sales by third parties, creating additional downward pressure on our share price; 

•certain provisions in the indentures governing the Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us;

•we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt, including the Notes, through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if 

34


Unity Software Inc.

any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Further, any such purchases or exchanges may result in us acquiring and retiring a substantial amount of such indebtedness, which could impact the trading liquidity of such indebtedness; and

•the conditional conversion features of the 2030 Notes and the 2026 Notes, if triggered, and the conversion feature of the 2027 Notes may adversely affect our liquidity if we elect or are required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash.

The conditional conversion features of the 2030 Notes and 2026 Notes, if triggered, and the conversion feature of the 2027 Notes may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.

In the event the conditional conversion features of the 2030 Notes or 2026 Notes is triggered, holders of the 2030 Notes or 2026 Notes will be entitled under the indenture governing the 2030 Notes or 2026 Notes to convert their 2030 Notes or 2026 Notes, as applicable, at any time during specified periods at their option. Holders of the 2027 Notes are entitled under the indenture governing the 2027 Notes to convert their 2027 Notes at any time prior to maturity. If one or more holders elect to convert their 2030 Notes or 2026 Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders are not able or do not elect to convert their 2030 Notes or 2026 Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to classify or reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the 2030 Notes or 2026 Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.

The capped call transactions may affect the value of the 2030 Notes or 2026 Notes and our common stock.

In addition, in connection with the issuance of the 2030 Notes and the 2026 Notes, we entered into capped call transactions (the "Capped Call Transactions") with certain of the initial purchasers of the 2030 Notes and 2026 Notes or affiliates thereof and other financial institutions (the "option counterparties"). The Capped Call Transactions cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of our common stock initially underlying the 2030 Notes and the 2026 Notes. The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of 2030 Notes or 2026 Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2030 Notes or 2026 Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the Capped Call Transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates likely entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or purchased shares of our common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the 2030 Notes or the 2026 Notes, including with certain investors in the 2030 Notes or the 2026 Notes. The option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 2030 Notes or the 2026 Notes (and are likely to do so on each exercise date of the Capped Call Transactions or, to the extent we exercise the relevant election under the Capped Call Transactions, following any repurchase, redemption or conversion of the 2030 Notes or the 2026 Notes). We cannot make any prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the prices of the 2030 Notes, 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes or the shares of our common stock. Any of these activities could adversely affect the value of the 2030 Notes, 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes and our common stock.

We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the Capped Call Transactions.

In addition, the option counterparties are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them might default under the Capped Call Transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the 

35


Unity Software Inc.

option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the Capped Call Transaction with such option counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock

Our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile, and the value of our common stock may decline.

The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and may fluctuate or decline substantially as a result of a variety of factors, including those discussed in the risk factors in this section, as well as variance in our financial performance from expectations of securities analysts, sales of shares of our common stock by us or our stockholders, sales of securities convertible into shares of our capital stock by us, the trading volume of our common stock, general economic and market conditions, and others not currently known to us or that we do not believe are material. In addition, our stock price has in the past fluctuated, and may in the future fluctuate, based on announcements or developments by our competitors or perceived competitors, or by other companies in similar industries, even if those announcements do not relate directly to our business. Technology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility. In the past, companies who have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. We have been, and may continue to be, the target of this type of litigation in the future, which could result in substantial expenses and divert our management's attention.

Future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the timing of or the effect that future sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.

Our issuance of additional capital stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our equity incentive plans or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.

We expect to issue additional capital stock in the future that will result in dilution to all other stockholders. We grant and expect to continue granting equity awards to employees and directors under our equity incentive plans. We may also raise capital through the sale and issuance of equity securities or convertible securities in the future. As part of our business strategy, we have in the past issued, and in the future may issue, equity securities to pay for acquisitions or investments. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause stockholders to experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our common stock to decline.

We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and, as a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.

We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, you may need to rely on sales of our common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on your investment.

If we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting, investor confidence in our company may be adversely affected and, as a result, the value of our common stock may be impacted.

We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our compliance with Section 404 requires that we incur substantial expenses and expend significant management efforts. Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. In addition, changes in accounting principles or interpretations could also challenge our internal controls and require that we establish new business processes, systems and controls to accommodate such changes. Additionally, if these new systems, controls or standards and the associated process changes do not give rise to the benefits that we expect or do not operate as intended, it could adversely affect our financial reporting systems and processes, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial reports or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, our business may be harmed if we experience problems with any new systems and controls that result in delays in their implementation or increased costs to correct any post-implementation issues that may arise.

In addition, management’s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting may identify weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed or other potential matters that may raise concerns for investors. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure of management’s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.

Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.

Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally, prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any “interested” stockholder for a period of three years. Any of the foregoing provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, and they could deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you would receive a premium for your shares of our common stock in an acquisition.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America as the exclusive forums for certain disputes between us and our stockholders, which restricts our stockholders' ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation includes choice of forum provisions which may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring such a claim arising under the Securities Act against us, our directors, officers, or other employees in a venue other than in the federal district courts of the United States of America. In such an instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving 

37


Unity Software Inc.

such action in other jurisdictions and we cannot assure you that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions. If a court were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could harm our business.
