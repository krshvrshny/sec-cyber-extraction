ITEM
1C. CYBERSECURITY

We
maintain various information security processes designed to identify, assess and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. 

Our
President and Chief Executive Officer is responsible for overseeing our cybersecurity processes and works directly with third party service
providers, as applicable, to identify, assess and manage the Company’s cybersecurity threats and risks. In doing so, he seeks to
identify and assess risks from cybersecurity threats in a manner appropriate for a company of comparable size and resources.

Our
assessment and management of material risks from cybersecurity threats are integrated into the Company’s overall risk management
processes. For example, our IT Consulting Firm works with management to prioritize our risk management processes and mitigate cybersecurity
threats that are more likely to lead to a material impact to our business.

Governance 

Our
Board of Directors addresses the Company’s cybersecurity risk management as part of its general oversight function. The Board is
responsible for overseeing Company’s cybersecurity risk management processes. Our cybersecurity risk assessment and management
processes are implemented and maintained by our President and Chief Executive Officer. 

Our
cybersecurity incident response and vulnerability management processes are designed to escalate certain cybersecurity incidents to members
of management and/or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. The Board receives periodic reports and updates from our
senior management concerning cybersecurity threats and risks, and the processes that the Company has implemented to address them.

We
are not aware of any instances of material cybersecurity incidents that impacted the Company.
